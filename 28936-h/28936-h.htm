<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>THE WORLD WITHOUT MAN</h3>
</div>
<p>It lay apparently afloat on the sluggish, faintly
discolored tide&ndash;&ndash;a placid, horse-faced, shovel-nosed
head, with bumpy holes for ears and immense
round eyes of a somewhat anxious mildness.</p>
<p>The anxiety in the great eyes was not without
reason, for their owner had just arrived in the tepid
and teeming waters of this estuary, and the creatures
which he had already seen about him were both unknown
and menacing. But the inshore shallows were
full of water-weeds of a rankness and succulence far
beyond anything he had enjoyed in his old habitat,
and he was determined to secure himself a place here.</p>
<p>From time to time, as some new monster came
in sight, the ungainly head would shoot up amazingly
to a distance of five or ten, or even fifteen feet,
on a swaying pillar of a neck, in order to get a
better view of the stranger. Then it would slowly
sink back again to its repose on the water.</p>
<p>The water at this point was almost fresh, because
the estuary, though fully two miles wide, was filled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
with the tide of the great river rolling slowly down
from the heart of the continent. The further shore
was so flat that nothing could be seen of it but an
endless, pale green forest of giant reeds. But the
nearer shore was skirted, at a distance of perhaps
half a mile from the water, by a rampart of abrupt,
bright, rust-red cliffs. The flat land between the waterside
and the cliffs, except for the wide strip of beach,
was clothed with an enormous and riotous growth of
calamaries, tree-ferns, cane and palm, which rocked
and crashed in places as if some colossal wayfarers
were pushing through them. Here and there along
the edge of the cliffs sat tall beings with prodigious,
saw-toothed beaks, like some species of bird conceived
in a nightmare.</p>
<p>Far out across the water one of these creatures
was flapping slowly in from the sea. Its wings&ndash;&ndash;eighteen
feet across from tip to tip&ndash;&ndash;were not the
wings of a bird, but of a bat or a hobgoblin. It
had dreadful, hand-like claws on its wing-elbows; and
its feet were those of a lizard.</p>
<p>As this startling shape came flapping shoreward,
the head afloat upon the water eyed it with interest,
but not, as it seemed, with any great apprehension.
Yet it certainly looked formidable enough to excite
misgivings in most creatures. Its flight was not the
steady, even winging of a bird, but spasmodic and
violent. It came on at a height of perhaps twenty feet
above the sluggish tide, and its immense, circular eyes
appeared to take no notice of the strange head that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
watched it from the water&#8217;s surface. It seemed about
to pass a little to one side, when suddenly, with a
hoarse, hooting cry, it swerved and swooped, and
struck at the floating head with open jaws.</p>
<p>Swift as was that unexpected attack, the assailant
struck nothing but a spot of foam where the head had
disappeared. Simultaneously with the lightning disappearance,
there was a sudden boiling of the water
some eighty-odd feet away. But the great bird-lizard
was either too furious to notice this phenomenon or
not sagacious enough to interpret it. Flopping into
the air again, and gnashing his beak-like jaws with
rage, he kept circling about the spot in heavy zigzags,
expecting the harmless looking head to reappear.</p>
<p>All at once his expectations were more than realized.
The head not only reappeared, but on a towering
leather-colored column of a neck it shot straight
into the air to a height of twenty feet. The big,
placid eyes were now sparkling with anger. The flat,
shovel jaws were gaping open. They seized the swooping
foe by the root of the tail, and, in spite of screeches
and wild flappings, plucked him down backwards.
At the surface of the water there was a convulsive
struggle, and the wide wings were drawn clean under.</p>
<p>For several minutes the water seethed and foamed,
and little waves ran clattering up the beach, while
the owner of the harmless-looking head trod his assailant
down and crushed him among the weeds of
the bottom. Then the foam slowly crimsoned, and
the mauled, battered body of the great bird-lizard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
came up again; for the owner of the mysterious head
was a feeder on delicate weeds and succulent green-stuff
only, and would eat no blood-bearing food. The
body was still struggling, and the vast, dark, broken
wings spread themselves in feeble spasms on the
surface. But they were not left to struggle long.</p>
<p>The water, in the distance, had been full of eager
spectators of the fight, and now it boiled as they
rushed in upon the disabled prey. Ravenous, cavern-jawed,
fishlike beasts, half-porpoise, half-alligator,
swarmed upon the victim, tearing at it and at each
other. Some bore off trailing mouthfuls of dark
wing-membrane, others more substantial booty, while
the rest fought madly in the vortex of discolored foam.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the fray the grim figures perched
along the red ramparts of the cliff had shown signs
of excitement, lifting their high shoulders and half
unfolding the stiff drapery of their wings. As they
saw their fellow overwhelmed they launched themselves
from their perch and came hooting hoarsely
over the rank, green tops of the palms and feathery
calamaries. Swooping and circling they gathered over
the hideous final struggle, and from time to time one
or another would drop perpendicularly downward to
stab the crown or the face of one of the preoccupied
fish-beasts with his trenchant beak. Such of the fish-beasts
as were thus disabled were promptly torn to
pieces and devoured by their companions.</p>
<p>Some fifty feet away, nearer shore, the harmless-looking
head which had been the source and inspirer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
of all this bloody turmoil lay watching the scene with
discontent in its round, wondering eyes. Slowly it
reared itself once more to a height of eight or ten
feet above the water, as if for better inspection of
the combat. Then, as if not relishing the neighborhood
of the fish-beasts, it slowly sank again and disappeared.</p>
<p>Immediately a heavy swirling, a disturbance that
stretched over a distance of nearly a hundred feet,
began to travel shoreward. It grew heavier and
heavier as the water grew shallower. Then a leather-colored
mountain of a back heaved itself up through
the smother and a colossal form, that would make the
hugest elephant a pigmy, came ponderously forth upon
the beach.</p>
<p>The body of this amazing being was thrice or four
times the bulk of the mightiest elephant. It stood
highest&ndash;&ndash;a good thirteen feet&ndash;&ndash;over the haunches
(which were supported on legs like columns), and
sloped abruptly to the lower and lighter-built fore-shoulders.
The neck was like a giraffe&#8217;s, but over
twenty feet in length to its juncture with the mild
little head, which looked as if Nature had set it there
as a pleasantry at the expense of the titanic body. The
tail, enormous at the base and tapering gradually to
a whip-lash, trailed out to a distance of nearly fifty
feet. As its owner came ashore, this tremendous tail
was gathered and curled in a semi-circle at his side&ndash;&ndash;perhaps
lest the delicate tip, if left too distant, might
fall a prey to some significant but agile marauder.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></p>
<p>For some minutes the colossus (he was one of the
Dinosaurs, or Terrible Lizards, and known as a
Diplodocus) remained on all-fours, darting his sinuous
neck inquiringly in all directions, and snatching here
and there a mouthful of the rank tender herbage which
grew among the trunks of fern and palm. Apparently
the spot was to his liking. Here was a wide beach,
sunlit and ample, whereon to bask at leisure. There
were the warm and weed-choked shallows wherein to
pasture, to wallow at will, to hide his giant bulk from
his enemies if there should be found any formidable
enough to make hiding advisable. Swarms of
savage insects, to be sure, were giving him a hot
reception&ndash;&ndash;mosquitoes of unimaginable size, and
enormous stinging flies which sought to deposit their
eggs in his smooth hide, but with his giraffe-like neck
he could bite himself where he would, and the lithe
lash of his tail could flick off tormentors from any
corner of his anatomy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the excitement off-shore had died down.
The harsh hootings of the bird-lizards had ceased
to rend the air as the dark wings hurtled away to seek
some remoter or less disturbed hunting-ground. Then
across the silence came suddenly a terrific crashing of
branches, mixed with gasping cries. Startled, the diplodocus
hoisted himself upon his hind-quarters, till
he sat up like a kangaroo, supported and steadied
by the base of his huge tail. In this position his
head, forty feet above the earth, overlooked the tops
of all but the tallest trees. And what he saw brought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
the look of anxiety once more into his round, saucer-eyes.</p>
<p>Hurling itself with desperate, plunging leaps through
the rank growths, and snapping the trunks of the
brittle tree-ferns in its path as if they had been cauliflowers,
came a creature not unlike himself, but of
less than half the size, and with neck and tail of
only moderate length. This creature was fleeing in
frantic terror from another and much smaller being,
which came leaping after it like a giant kangaroo.
Both were plainly dinosaurs, with the lizard tail and
hind-legs; but the lesser of the two, with its square,
powerful head and tiger-fanged jaws, and the tremendous,
rending claws on its short forearms, was plainly
of a different species from the great herb-eaters of the
dinosaurian family. It was one of the smaller
members of that terrible family of carnivorous dinosaurians
which ruled the ancient cycad forests as the
black-maned lion rules the Rhodesian jungles to-day.
The massive iguanodon which fled before it so madly,
though of fully thrice its bulk, had reason to fear it
as the fat cow fears a wolf.</p>
<p>A moment more, and the dreadful chase, with a
noise of raucous groans and pantings, burst forth into
the open, not fifty feet from where the colossus stood
watching. Almost at the watcher&#8217;s feet the fugitive
was overtaken. With a horrid leap and a hoot of
triumph, the pursuer sprang upon its neck and bore it
to the ground, where it lay bellowing hoarsely and
striking out blunderingly with the massive, horn-tipped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
spur which armed its clumsy wrist. The victor tore
madly at its throat with tooth and claw, and presently
its bellowing subsided to a hideous, sobbing gurgle.</p>
<p>The diplodocus, meanwhile, had been looking down
upon the scene with half-bewildered apprehension.
These creatures were insignificant in size, to be sure,
as compared with his own colossal stature, but the
smaller one had a swift ferocity which struck terror
to his dull heart.</p>
<p>Suddenly a red wrath mounted to his small and
sluggish brain. His tail, as we have seen, was curled
in a half-circle at his side. Now he bent his body with
it. For an instant his whole bulk quivered with the
extraordinary tension. Then, like a bow released, the
bent body sprang back. The tail (and it weighed at
least a ton) struck the victor and the victim together
with an annihilating shock, and swept them clean
around beneath the visitor&#8217;s feet.</p>
<p>Down he came upon them at once, with the crushing
effect of a hundred steam pile-drivers; and for the
next few minutes his panicky rage expended itself in
treading the two bodies into a shapeless mass. Then
he slowly backed off down into the water where the
weedy growths were thickest, till once more his whole
form was concealed except the insignificant head.
This he reared among the swaying tufts of the &#8220;mares&#8217;
tails,&#8221; and waited to see what strange thing would
happen next.</p>
<p>He had not long to wait. That hideous, mangled
heap there, sweating blood in the noon sun, seemed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
to have some way of making its presence known.
Crashing sounds arose in different parts of the forest,
and presently some half-dozen of the leaping,
kangaroo-like flesh-eaters appeared.</p>
<p>They were of varying sizes, from ten or twelve
feet in length to eighteen or twenty, and they eyed
each other with jealous hostility. But one glance at
the weltering heap showed them that here was feasting
abundant for them all. With a chorus of hoarse
cries they came hopping forward and fell upon it.</p>
<p>Presently two vast shadows came overhead, hovering
a moment, and a pair of the great bird-lizards
dropped upon the middle of the heap. Hooting
savagely, with wings half uplifted, they struck about
them with their terrible beaks till they had secured
room for themselves at the banquet. Other unbidden
guests came leaping from among the thickets; and in
a short time there was nothing left of the carcasses except
two naked skeletons, dragged apart and half dismembered
by mighty teeth. In the final m&ecirc;l&eacute;e one
of the smaller revellers was himself pounced upon
and devoured.</p>
<p>Then, as if by consent of a mutual distrust, the
throng drew quickly apart, each eyeing his neighbor
warily, and scattered into the woods. Only the two
grim bird-lizards remained, seeming to have a sort
of understanding or partnership, or possibly being a
mated pair. They pried into the cartilages and between
the joints of the skeletons with the iron wedges of
their beaks, till there was not another tit-bit to be enjoyed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
Then, hooting once more with satisfaction,
they spread their batlike vanes and flapped darkly off
again to their red watch-tower on the cliff.</p>
<p>When all was once more quiet the giant visitor
fell to pasturing among the crisp and tender water-weeds.
It took a long time to fill his cavernous
paunch by way of that slender neck of his, and when
he was satisfied he went composedly to sleep, his body
perfectly concealed under the water, his head resting
on a little islet of matted reeds in a thicket of &#8220;mares&#8217;
tails.&#8221; When he woke up again the sun was half-way
down to the west, and the beach glowed hotly
in the afternoon light. Everything was drenched in
heavy stillness. The visitor made up his drowsy mind
that he must leave his hiding-place and go and bask
in that delicious warmth.</p>
<p>He was just bestirring himself to carry out his
purpose, when once more a swaying in the rank foliage
of the cycads caught his vigilant eye. Discreetly he
drew back into hiding, the place being, as he had
found it, so full of violent surprises.</p>
<p>Suddenly there emerged upon the beach a monster
even more extraordinary in appearance than himself.
It was about thirty-five feet in length, and its ponderous
bulk was supported on legs so short and bowed
that it crawled with its belly almost dragging the
ground. Its small head, which it carried close to
the earth, was lizard-like, shallow-skulled, feeble-looking,
and its jaws cleft back past the stupid eyes. In
fact, it was an inoffensive-looking head for such an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
imposing body. At the base of the head began a
system of defensive armor that looked as if it might
be proof against artillery. Up over the shoulders,
over the mighty arch of the back, and down over the
haunches as far as the middle of the ponderous tail,
ran a series of immense flat plates of horn, with
pointed tips and sharpened edges. The largest of
these plates, those that covered the center of the back,
were each three feet in height, and almost of an
equal breadth. Where the diminished plates came to
an end at the middle of the tail, their place was taken
by eight immense, needle-pointed spines, set in pairs,
of which the chief pair had a length of over two feet.
The monster&#8217;s hide was set thick with scales and
knobs of horn, brilliantly colored in black, yellow, and
green, that his grotesque bulk might be less noticeable
to his foes among the sharp shadows and patchy lights
of the fern jungles where he fed.</p>
<p>The sluggish giant moved nervously, glancing backwards
as he came, and seemed intent upon reaching
the water. In a few moments his anxiety was explained.
Leaping in splendid bounds along his broad
trail came two of those same ferocious flesh-eaters
whom the great watcher among the reeds so disliked.
They ranged up one on each side of the stegosaur, who
had halted at their approach, stiffened himself, and
drawn his head so far back into the loose skin of
his neck that only the sharp, chopping beak projected
from under the first armor-plate. One of the pair
threatened him from the front, as if to engross his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
attention, while the other pounced upon one of his
massive, bowed hind-legs, as if seeking to drag it from
beneath him and roll him over on his side.</p>
<p>But at this instant there was a clattering of the
plated hide, and that armed tail lashed out with lightning
swiftness, like a porcupine&#8217;s. There was a tearing
screech from the rash flesh-eater, and he was
plucked back sidewise, all four feet in air, deeply impaled
on three of those gigantic spines. While he
clawed and writhed, struggling to twist himself free,
his companion sprang hardily to the rescue. She
hurled herself with all her weight and strength full
upon the stegosaur&#8217;s now unprotected flank. So
tremendous was the impact that, with a frightened
grunt, he was rolled clean over on his side. But at
the same time his sturdy forearms clutched his assailant,
and so crushed, mauled and tore her that she
was glad to wrench herself away.</p>
<p>Coughing and gasping, she bounded backwards out
of reach; and then she saw that her mate, having
wriggled off the spines, was dragging himself up the
beach toward the forest, leaving a trail of blood behind
him. She followed sullenly, having had more than
enough of the venture. The triumphant stegosaur
rolled himself heavily back upon his feet, grunted
angrily, clattered his armored plates, jerked his terrible
tail from side to side as if to see that it was still in
working order, and went lumbering off to another
portion of the wood, having apparently forgotten his
purpose of taking to the water. As he went, one of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
the grim bird-lizards from the cliff swooped down and
hovered, hooting over his path, apparently disappointed
at his triumph.</p>
<p>The watcher in the reeds, on the other hand, was
encouraged by the result of the combat. He began
to feel a certain dangerous contempt for those leaping
flesh-eaters, in spite of their swiftness and ferocity.
He himself, though but an eater of weeds, had trodden
one into nothingness, and now he had seen two together
overthrown and put to flight. With growing confidence
he came forth from his hiding, stalked up the
beach, coiled his interminable tail beside him, and lay
down to bask his dripping sides in the full blaze of the
sun.</p>
<p>The colossus was at last beginning to feel at home
in his new surroundings. In spite of the fact that
this bit of open beach, overlooked by the deep green
belt of jungle and the rampart of red cliffs, appeared
to be a sort of arena for titanic combats, he began
to have confidence in his own astounding bulk as a
defense against all foes. What matter his slim neck,
small head and feeble teeth, when that awful engine
of his tail could sweep his enemies off their feet, and
he could crush them by falling upon them like a
mountain! A pair of the great bird-lizards flapped
over him, hooting malignantly and staring down upon
him with their immense, cold eyes, but he hardly took
the trouble to look up at them.</p>
<p>Warmed and well fed, his eyes half-sheathed in
their membraneous lids, he gazed out vacantly across
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
the waving herbage of the shallows, across the slow,
pale tides whose surface boiled from time to time
above the rush of some unseen giant of a shark or
ichthyosaur.</p>
<p>In the heavy heat of the afternoon the young world
had become very still. The bird-lizards, all folded
in their wings, sat stiff and motionless along the
ramparts of red cliff. The only sounds were the hiss
of those seething rushes far out on the tide, the sudden
droning hum of some great insect darting overhead,
or the occasional soft clatter of the long, crisp cycad
leaves as a faint puff of hot air lifted them.</p>
<p>At the back of the beach, where the tree-ferns and
the calamaries grew rankest, the foliage parted noiselessly
at a height of perhaps twenty feet from the
ground, and a dreadful head looked forth. Its jaws
were both long and massive, and armed with immense,
curved teeth like scimitars. Its glaring eyes were
overhung by eaves of bony plate, and from the front
of its broad snout rose a single horn, long and sharp.
For some minutes this hideous apparition eyed the unconscious
colossus by the waterside. Then it came
forth from the foliage and crept noiselessly down the
beach.</p>
<p>Except for its horned snout and armored eyes, this
monster was not unlike in general type to those other
predatory dinosaurs which had already appeared upon
the scene. But it was far larger, approaching thirty-five
feet in length, and more powerfully built in proportion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
to its size; and the armory of its jaws was
more appalling. With a stealthy but clumsy-looking
waddle, which was nevertheless soundless as a shadow,
and his huge tail curled upwards that it might not
drag and rattle the stones, he crept down until he was
within some fifty feet or more of the drowsing colossus.</p>
<p>Some premonition of peril, at this moment, began
to stir in the heavy brain of the colossus, and he
lifted his head apprehensively. In the same instant
the horned giant gathered himself, and hurled himself
forward. In two prodigious leaps he covered the
distance that separated him from his intended prey.
The coiled tail of the colossus lashed out irresistibly,
but the assailant cleared it in his spring, fell upon the
victim&#8217;s shoulders, and buried his fangs in the base
of that columnar neck.</p>
<p>The colossus, for the first time, was overwhelmed
with terror. He gave vent to a shrill, bleating bellow&ndash;&ndash;an
absurdly inadequate utterance to issue from this
mountainous frame&ndash;&ndash;writhed his neck in snaky folds,
and lashed out convulsively with the stupendous coils
of his tail. But he could not loosen that deep grip, or
the clutch of those iron claws.</p>
<p>In spite of the many tons weight throttling his
neck, he reared himself aloft, and strove to throw himself
over upon his assailant. But the marauder was
agile, and eluded the crushing fall without loosing his
grip. Then, bleating frightfully, till the sounds re-&euml;choed
from the red cliffs and set all the drowsing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
bird-lizards lifting their wings, he plunged down into
the tide and bore his dreadful adversary out of sight
beneath a smother of ensanguined foam.</p>
<p>Now, the horned giant was himself a powerful
swimmer and quite at home in the water, but in this
respect he was no match for his quarry. Refusing
to relinquish his hold, he was borne out into deep
water; and there the colossus, becoming all at once
agile and swift, succeeded in rolling over upon him.
Forced thus to loose his grip, he gave one long, ripping
lunge with his horn, deep into the victim&#8217;s flank, and
then writhed himself from under. The breath quite
crushed out of him, he was forced to rise to the surface
for air. There he rested, recovering his self-possession,
reluctant to give up the combat, but even more
reluctant to expose himself to another such mauling in
the depths. As he hesitated, about a hundred feet
away he saw the mild little head of the colossus, apparently
floating on the tide, and regarding him anxiously.
That decided him. With a crashing bellow
of rage and a sweep of his powerful tail he darted at
the inoffensive head. But it vanished instantly, and a
sudden tremendous turmoil, developing into a wake
that lengthened out with the speed of a torpedo-boat,
showed him the hopelessness of pursuit. Turning
abruptly, he swam back to the shore and sulkily withdrew
into the thickets to seek some less unmanageable
quarry.</p>
<p>The colossus, so deeply wounded that his trail threw
up great clots and bubbles of red foam, swam onward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
several miles up the estuary. He realized now that
that patch of sunny beach was just a death-trap. But
in the middle of the estuary, far out from either shore,
far removed from the unseen, lurking horrors of the
fern forests, spread acre upon acre of drowned marsh,
overgrown with tall green reeds and feathery &#8220;mares&#8217;
tails.&#8221; Through these stretches of marsh he ploughed
his way, half-swimming, half-wading, and felt that
here he might find a safe refuge as well as an unfailing
pasturage. But the anguish of his wounds urged him
still onwards.</p>
<p>Beyond the reed-beds he came to a long, narrow islet
of wet sand, naked to the sun. This appeared to him
the very refuge he was craving, a spot where he could
lie secure and lick his hurts. He dragged himself out
upon it eagerly. Not until he had gained the very center
of it did he notice how his ponderous feet sank in
it at every stride. As soon as he halted he felt the
treacherous sands sucking him down. In terror he
struggled to free himself, to regain the water. But
now the sands had a grip upon him, and his efforts only
engulfed him the more swiftly. He reared upon his
hind legs, and immediately found himself swallowed to
the haunches. He fell forward again, and sank to his
shoulder-blades. And then, the convulsive thrashings
of his tail hurling the sands in every direction, he
lifted his head and bleated piteously.</p>
<p>The struggle had already drawn the dreadful eyes
of those grim, folded figures perched along the cliff-tops
miles away; and now, as if in answer to his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
cry they came fluttering darkly over him. Seeing his
helplessness, they flapped down upon him with hoots
of exultation. Their vast beaks tore at his helpless
back, and stabbed at the swiftly writhing convolutions
of his neck. One, more heedless than his fellows,
came within reach of the thrashing tail, and was dashed,
half stunned, to earth, where the sands got him in
their hold before he could recover himself. With
dreadful screeches, he was sucked down, but his fellows
paid no attention to his fate. And meanwhile, in a
ring about the islet, not daring to come near
for terror of the quicksand, crocodiles and alligators
and ichthyosaurs, with upturned, gaping snouts,
watched the struggle greedily.</p>
<p>As the lower part of his neck was drawn down
into the quicksand, the colossus lost the power to move
his head quickly enough to evade the attacks of
his horrid assailants. A moment more, and he was
blinded. Then he felt his head enfolded in the strangling
membranes of wings and borne downwards. Once
or twice the convulsions of his neck threw his enemies
off, and the bleeding, sightless head re&euml;merged to view.</p>
<p>But not only his force, but his will to struggle, was
fast ebbing away. Presently, with a thunderous, gasping
sob, the last breath left his mighty lungs, and his
head dropped on the sand. It was trodden under in
an instant; and then, afraid of being engulfed themselves,
the hooting revellers abandoned it, to crowd
struggling upon the arched hump of the back. Here
they tore and gorged and quarreled till, some fifteen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
minutes later, their last foothold sank beneath them.
Then, with dripping beaks and talons, they all flapped
back to their cliffs; and slowly the fluent sand smoothed
itself to shining complacency over the tomb of the diplodocus,
hiding and sealing away the stupendous
skeleton for half a million years.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE KING OF THE TRIPLE HORN</h3>
</div>
<p>It was a little later in the Morning of Time&ndash;&ndash;later
by perhaps some two or three hundred thousand
years. Monstrous mammals now held sway over the
fresh, green round of the young earth, so exuberant in
her youthful vigor that she could not refrain from
flooding the Poles themselves with a tropical luxuriance
of flower and tree. The supremacy of the Giant
Reptiles had passed.</p>
<p>A few representatives of their most colossal and
highly-specialized forms still survived, still terrible
and supreme in those vast, steaming, cane-clothed
savannahs which most closely repeated the conditions
of an earlier age. But Nature, pleased with her experiments
in the more promising mammalian type, had
turned her back upon them after her fashion, and was
coldly letting them die out. Her failures, however
splendid, have always found small mercy at her hands.</p>
<p>But it was little like a failure he looked, the giant
who now heaved his terrible, three-horned front from
the lilied surface of the lagoon wherein he had been
wallowing, and came ponderously ploughing his way
ashore. As he emerged upon dry ground, he halted&ndash;&ndash;with
the tip of his massive, lizard-like tail still in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
water&ndash;&ndash;and shook a shower from the hollows of his
vast and strangely armored head.</p>
<p>His eyes, coldly furious, and set in a pair of goggle-like
projections of horn, peered this way and that, as
if suspecting the neighborhood of a foe. His gigantic
snout&ndash;&ndash;horned, cased in horn, and hooked like the beak
of a parrot&ndash;&ndash;he lifted high, sniffing the heavy air.
Then, as if to end his doubts by either drawing or
daunting off the unknown enemy, he opened his
grotesquely awful mouth and roared. The huge
sound that exploded from his throat was something
between the bellow of an alligator and the coughing
roar of a tiger, but of infinitely vaster volume.</p>
<p>The next moment, as if in deliberate reply to the
challenge, an immense black beast stepped from behind
a thicket of pea-green bamboo, and stood scrutinizing
him with wicked little pig-like eyes.</p>
<p>It was the old order confronted by the new, the
latest most terrible and perhaps most efficient of the
titanic but vanishing race of the Dinosaurs, face to
face with one of those monstrous mammalian forms
upon which Nature was now trying her experiments.</p>
<p>And the place of this meeting was not unfitted to
such a portentous encounter. The further shore of
the lagoon was partly a swamp of rankest growth,
partly a stretch of savannah clothed with rich cane-brake
and flowering grasses that towered fifteen or
twenty feet into the air. But the hither shore was
of a hard soil mixed with sand, carpeted with a short,
golden-green herbage, and studded with clumps of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
bamboo, jobo, mango and mahogany, with here and
there a thicket of canary-flowered acacia, bristling
with the most formidable of thorns.</p>
<p>They were not altogether ill-matched, these two
colossal protagonists of the Saurian and the Mammal.
The advantage of bulk lay altogether with the Dinosaur,
the three-horned King of all the Lizard kind.
His armament, too, whether for offense or for defense,
was distinctly the more formidable. Fully twenty
feet in length, and perhaps eight feet high at the crest
of the massively-rounded back, he was of ponderous
breadth, and moved ponderously on legs like columns.</p>
<p>His splotched brown and yellow hide was studded
along the neck and shoulders with pointed knobs of
horn. His enormous, fleshy tail, some seven feet long
and nearly two feet thick at the base, tapered very
gradually to a thick tip, and dragged on the ground
behind him. But the most amazing thing about this
King of the Lizards was his monstrous and awe-inspiring
head.</p>
<p>Wedge-shaped from the tip of its cruel parrot-beak
to its spreading, five-foot-wide base, its total length
was well over seven feet. Its three horns, one on
the snout and two standing out straight forward from
the forehead just above the eyes, were immensely
thick at the base and fined down smoothly to points of
terrible keenness. The one on the snout was something
over a foot in length, while the brow pair were
nearly three feet long.</p>
<p>Almost from the roots of these two terrific weapons
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
protruded the huge horn goggles which served as
sockets for the great, cold, implacable lizard-eyes.
Behind the horns, outspreading like a vast ruff from
three to four feet wide upwards and laterally, slanted
a smooth, polished shield of massive shell like the carapace
of a giant turtle, protecting the neck and shoulders
from any imaginable attack.</p>
<p>The antagonist who had come in answer to the
giant&#8217;s challenge was less extravagant in appearance
and more compact in form. He was not much over
a dozen feet in length, but this length owed nothing
to the tail, which was a mere wriggling pendant. He
was, perhaps, seven feet high, very sturdy in build,
but not mountainous like his terrible challenger. His
legs and feet were something like those of an elephant,
and he looked capable of a deadly alertness in action.
But, as in the case of the King Dinosaur, it was his
head that gave him his chief distinction. Long, massive
and blunt-nosed, it was armed not only with six
horns, set in pairs, but also with a pair of deadly,
downward-pointing tusks&ndash;&ndash;like those of a walrus, but
much shorter, sharper and more effective.</p>
<p>Of the six horns, the first pair, set on the tip of the
broad snout, were mere bony points, of no use as
weapons, and employed by their owner for rooting in
the turf after the fashion of a tuber-hunting pig.
The second pair, set about the middle of the long face,
just over the eyes, were about eighteen inches in
length, and redoubtable enough to make other weapons
seem superfluous.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></p>
<p>The third pair, however, were equally formidable,
and set far back at the very base of the skull, like those
of an antelope. The eyes, as has been already stated,
were small, deep-set and vindictive. The sullen black
of his coloring added to the portentousness of his
swift appearance around the clump of pea-green
bamboo.</p>
<p>For several minutes the two monsters stood eyeing
each other, while the rage of an instinctive hatred
mounted slowly in their sluggish brains. To the King
Dinosaur, this stranger was a trespasser on his domain,
where no other creatures, unless of his own kind, had
ever before had the presumption to confront him. The
suddenness of the black apparition, also, exasperated
him; and he loathed at once the sickly sour smell,
so unlike the pungent muskiness of his own
kindred, which now for the first time met his sensitive
nostrils.</p>
<p>The Dinoceras, on his part, was in a chronic state
of rage. He was a solitary old bull, driven out, for
his bad temper, from the comfortable herd of his
fellows, and burning to find vent for his bottled spleen.
The herd, in one of its migrations, had just arrived
in the neighborhood of the great lagoons, and he, in his
furious restlessness, was unconsciously playing the part
of vanguard to it.</p>
<p>He had never, of course, conceived of so terrible
an adversary as this splotched brown and yellow
monster before him. But he was in no mood to calculate
odds. For all his blind rage, however, he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
a crafty fighter, always. Seeing that the challenger
made no move, he gave voice to a huge, squealing grunt,
like the noise of a herd of raging pigs. Then he dug
his armed snout into the turf and hurled a shower of
sod into the air.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the King Dinosaur this was apparently
an intolerable insult. With a roar he came
lumbering forward, at a slow, rolling run which seemed
to jar the earth. Grunting again, and moving at
thrice his speed, the black beast rushed to meet him,
head down, like a charging bison.</p>
<p>They met under the spreading branches of an immense
hoya-tree. But they did not meet fairly, head
to head, as the Dinosaur intended. Had they done
so the battle would have been decided then and there,
for the black beast&#8217;s horns and unprotected front were
no match for the impenetrable armor and leveled
lances of the King&#8217;s colossal head. But they did not
meet fairly. The black stranger was much too crafty
for that. At the last moment he swerved nimbly aside,
wheeled with an agility that was marvelous for a creature
of his bulk, and thrust at the shoulders of the
colossus with a fierce, rooting movement like the stroke
of the wild boar.</p>
<p>But he struck the rim of that impenetrable defense,
the spreading ruff of horn. And he might as well have
struck a mountain-side. That enormous bulk, firm-based
on the wide-set columns which formed its legs,
merely staggered an instant, coughed from the jarring
of the blow, and swung about to present his terrific
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
horns against another such attack. The black stranger,
meanwhile, as if disappointed at the meager result of
his tactics, had drawn back out of reach. He stood
rooting the turf and squealing defiance, in the hope
of luring the giant into a second charge.</p>
<p>The stupendous duel had two interested spectators.
On the top of the next tree sat an extraordinary-looking
bird, about the size of a pheasant, colored blue and
rose like a macaw. Its tail was like a lizard&#8217;s, long
and fully-vertebrated, with a pair of flat feathers
standing out opposite each other at right angles from
each joint, for all the world like an immense acacia-frond
done in red. At the tips of its wing-elbows it
carried clutching, hand-like claws, resembling those
of the flying reptiles; and its straight, strong beak was
armed with pointed teeth. It kept opening and shutting
its beak excitedly and uttering sharp cries, as if
calling everyone to come and see the fight.</p>
<p>The other spectator was not excited at all. He was
a large, ape-like man&ndash;&ndash;one would have said, rather, a
manlike ape, had it not been for the look in his eyes.</p>
<p>This enigmatic figure sat on a branch immediately
over the combatants, and held on with one powerful,
hairy hand to the branch just above him. He
was covered with thick, brown hair, like fur, from head
to foot, but that on his head was true hair, long and
waving. His shoulders were massive, his chest of
great depth, his arms so long that if he had been standing
erect they would have hung to his knees, his legs
short, massive and much bowed. His hands were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
furred to the second joint of the fingers, but they were
the hands of a man, not those of an ape, for the huge
thumb was opposed to the fingers instead of being set
parallel with them like another finger. His head was
low in the arch of the skull, low and narrow in the forehead,
with a small facial angle and hardly any bridge
to the broad, flat, wide-nostriled nose; and the jaws
were heavy and thrust forward brutishly. But the
eyes, under the roof of the heavy, bony brows, held
an expression profoundly unlike the cold, mechanical
stare of the giant Dinosaur or the twinkling, vindictive
glare of the black stranger. They gazed
down at the battle with a sort of superiority, considerate,
a little scornful, in spite of the obvious fact
that either of the two, as far as mere physical bulk
and prowess were concerned, could have obliterated
him by simply setting foot upon him. In his free hand
he grasped a branch of acacia set with immense thorns,
the needle-like points of which he touched contemplatively
from time to time, as if pondering what use
he could put them to. He had no marked prejudice,
for the moment, in favor of either side in the battle
below him. Both monsters were his foes, and the
ideal result, in his eyes, would have been for the two to
destroy each other. But if he had any preference, it
was for the black mammalian beast, the lizard monster
appearing to him the more alien, the more incomprehensible
and the more impregnable to any strategy that
he might devise.</p>
<p>For perhaps a couple of minutes, now, the King
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
kept his place, wheeling ponderously to face his agile
opponent, who circled about him at a distance of ten
to twelve yards, seeking an opportunity to get in a
rush upon his open flank. This wheeling and circling
made the cool watcher in the tree impatient. Wrenching
off a heavy branch, he hurled it down with all his
force upon the King&#8217;s face. To the King this seemed
but another insult from his black antagonist, and his
rage exploded once more. With a roar he wallowed
forward, thinking to pin the elusive foe to earth and
tread the life out of him.</p>
<p>This gave the black beast his opportunity. Doubling
nimbly like a wild boar, he dashed in and caught
his colossal opponent fairly on the side, midway
between the shoulder and the haunch. The impact
shocked the breath from the monster&#8217;s lungs, with a
huge, explosive cough, and brought him to a bewildered
standstill, though it could not throw him from his
feet. But the armored hide proved too tough for the
black beast&#8217;s horns to penetrate. Perceiving this on
the instant, the latter reared, and brought down the
two awful daggers of his tusks upon the monster&#8217;s
ribs. They penetrated, but they failed to rip as far
and as conclusively as their owner intended. And
while he struggled to free himself for another attack,
the monster recovered from his daze.</p>
<p>Now the stranger had taken count only of those
weapons which the King Dinosaur bore on his terrible
front; and these for the moment were out of reach.
But he had forgotten the massive and tremendous tail.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
Suddenly it lashed out, nearly half a ton in weight, and
with the force of a pile-driver. It struck the black
beast on the legs, and swept them clean from under
him.</p>
<p>Before he could pick himself up the Dinosaur had
swung about and buried all three horns, to the sockets,
in his throat and chest. His life went out in one ear-splitting
squeal of rage and anguish. The red blood
streaming from horns and ruff, the monster wrenched
himself free, and then moved irresistibly over his
victim, like a rolling mountain.</p>
<p>When satisfied that his triumph was complete, the
King drew back a pace or two, and examined the
mangled heap with his cold, unchanging stare. Then
he sniffed at it contemptuously, and prodded it with
his nose-horn, and tore it with his extravagant parrot-beak.
But, being a feeder on herbage only, he had not
thought of tasting the red flesh. The smell of it was
abominable to him; and presently he moved closer under
the trees to wipe his beak, as a bird might, on a clump
of coarse grasses.</p>
<p>As he did so, the lowering of his head threw his
horny ruff far forward, exposing the folds of naked
hide on the back of his neck. The silent man-creature
on the branch above was quick to note the opportunity.
He was displeased at the monster&#8217;s triumph. He was
also interested to see if he had any power to hurt so
colossal and well protected a foe. Swinging down by
his legs and one hand, he thrust the thorned branch of
acacia deep in under the ruff. The monster, jerking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
his head up sharply at this unexpected assault, drove
the long thorns well home.</p>
<p>In an instant he was beside himself with rage and
pain. Roaring till the blue-and-crimson bird on the
tree-top flew off in a panic, he shook his head desperately,
and then almost tried to stand upon it. He
started to roll over on his back, hoping thus to dislodge
the galling thing beneath the carapace, but
thought better of it at the first added pressure. His
contortions were so vehement that the man discreetly
drew himself up to a higher branch, a slow grin widening
his heavy mouth, as he marked his power to inflict
injury on even such an adversary as the King
Dinosaur. The experiment had been successful
beyond his utmost anticipations. Like Nature herself,
he was continually experimenting, but by no means always
with satisfactory results.</p>
<p>Suddenly the monster made off, with head held as
low as possible, for the edge of the lagoon. Ploughing
his way in with a huge splashing, he disappeared beneath
the water. A minute later he returned to the
surface and swam rapidly towards the jungle on the
opposite shore, probably intending to find some projecting
stump of a dead limb on which he could scratch
the torment from under his ruff. At the edge of the
jungle he was joined by another monster, like himself,
but smaller&ndash;&ndash;probably one of his mates&ndash;&ndash;and together
they disappeared, with heavy crashings, in the rank
tangle of the swamp-growths.</p>
<p>The man-creature descended from his refuge, carrying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
in one hand a heavy fragment of branch, which
he held awkwardly, as if not over-familiar with the
idea of an artificial weapon. He seemed to be groping
his way towards some use of it, either as a club or as
a stabbing instrument. During the fight, while he was
experimenting with the thorn branch, he had evidently
had this weapon lodged in some safe crotch. And now
he kept handling it with a curious interest.</p>
<p>Standing erect, he might easily have been mistaken
for a slightly built and shapelier variety of the gorilla
but for the true man-hands and the steady, contemplative,
foreseeing look in the eyes. He came and examined
the mangled bulk of the Dinoceras, scrutinized
the horns and tusks minutely, and strove with all his
force to wrench one of the latter from its socket, as if
hoping to make some use of it. Then, fastidiously
selecting a shred of the victim&#8217;s torn flesh, he sniffed
and nibbled at it, and then threw it aside. He could
eat and enjoy flesh-food at a pinch. But just now
fruit was abundant; and fruit, with eggs and honey,
formed the diet he preferred. As he stood pondering
the lifeless mass before him, a shrill call came to his
ears, and, turning sharply, he saw his mate, with her
baby in the crook of her hairy arm, standing at the
foot of a tree, and signaling him to come to her. As
soon as she saw that he understood, and was coming,
she swung herself lightly up into the branches. He ran
to the tree, climbed after her, and followed her to the
very top, where she awaited him. The tree was taller
than any of its neighbors, and commanded a clear
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
view of the meadow-lands that lay a half mile back
from the lagoon. His mate was pointing eagerly to
these meadows. He saw that they were dotted and
spotted with groups of great black, horned and tusked
beasts like the one whose destruction he had just witnessed.
These were the migrant herds of the Dinoceras,
just arrived at their new pasturage. The man
eyed them with discontent. He had seen a specimen
of their temper; and he congratulated himself that he
and his mate knew how to live in trees.</p>
<p>The man-creature himself was a new-comer to the
shores of the great lagoon. The place suited him admirably
by reason of the abundance of its fruits.
Along the banks of the lagoon were innumerable little
groves of plantain, the rich sustaining fruit of which
was of all foods his favorite. And he had found no
trace whatever of his most dangerous enemies, the
gigantic and implacable black lion of the caves, the red
bear and the saber-tooth.</p>
<p>Such an irresistible giant as the King of the Triple
Horn he might wonder at, and hate, but he thought
he had little cause to fear him. It is easy enough, if
one is prudent, to avoid a mountain.</p>
<p>Having found the place good, and resolved to stay,
the man had built a refuge for himself and his family
in this tall watch-tower of a tree. With interwoven
branches he had made a rude but substantial platform,
and carpeted it to something like softness with smaller
branches and twigs. A similar but lighter platform
overhead made him a roof that was anything but waterproof,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
and a few bushy branches served for walls.
Such as it was, it was at least the beginning of a home.
He loved it; and in defense of the little hairy brown
mate and downy brown baby who shared it with him
he would have fought both Dinosaur and Dinoceras
with his naked hands.</p>
<p>For some days nothing more was seen of the two
Dinosaurs, the King being probably occupied, in the
depths of the jungle, with the nursing of his wrath
and his hurts. The herds of the Dinoceras, meanwhile,
kept to their meadows, having better drinking-water
in a slow stream which traversed the pastures
than in the brackish tide of the lagoon.</p>
<p>Then came a morning when the brown mother, babe
on arm, was gathering plantains not far from the
waterside, while the man chanced to be away exploring
the limits of his new domain. The woman looked
up suddenly; and there, almost upon her, was the
giant horror of the Dinosaur, his cold, expressionless
eyes gaping at her immovably from their goggling
sockets. She turned to flee; and there was the
monster&#8217;s mate, not quite so huge, but equally appalling.
Behind her was an impenetrable wall of thorn-acacia.
There was only one refuge&ndash;&ndash;a tree, all too small, but
lofty enough to take her beyond the reach of those
horrifying horned and immobile masks. Up the little
tree she went, nimbly as a monkey, and crouched
shivering in a crotch. The slender trunk swayed beneath
her weight. She clutched the brown baby to her
heart, and sent shriek after shriek through the glades.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></p>
<p>A mile away the man heard it. He gave one deep-chested
shout in answer, and then came running in
silence, saving his breath.</p>
<p>But it was a mile he had to come. The female
Dinosaur, the more instantly malignant of the two,
hurled herself upon the trunk of the tree. It swayed
horribly, but did not yield at once. Thereupon the
two began to root beneath it with their horns, having
often used this method to obtain fruits which were
above their reach. The tree leaned far over. The
giant straddled it as a moose straddles a poplar sapling,
and bore it down irresistibly. Its top touched
earth.</p>
<p>The brown mother sprang forth with a tremendous
leap, clearing the horns with a twist which
nearly broke her back. She thought herself free.
And then a gigantic tail struck her and felled her
senseless. A second more, and the female Dinosaur&#8217;s
great foot crushed her and the wailing babe
out of existence together.</p>
<p>The swift end of the tragedy the man had seen as
he came racing down a stretch of open glade. He
did not need to look at the awful thing beneath the
monster&#8217;s foot to know that all was over. Beyond
one hoarse groan he uttered not a sound. But
blindly&ndash;&ndash;for he had never yet practised such an art&ndash;&ndash;he
hurled his ragged club at the nearest monster.
It rebounded like a baby&#8217;s rattle from the vast horn-armored
head. But a lucky chance had guided it.
One of its sharp, splintered knots struck fairly in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
Dinosaur&#8217;s eye, and smashed it in the socket. She
roared with agony; and the two, side by side, came
lunging towards him.</p>
<p>The man ran back slowly. His despairing grief
had changed suddenly into a cold hate and a resolve
for vengeance. It was so easy for him to outstrip
these lumbering monsters who were spouting their
fetid, musky breath close upon his heels. He stumbled
carefully at every other step. He let them feel
that at the next stride they would transfix him. He
led them on, the earth shaking beneath their tread,
till another fifty feet would have brought them out
upon the skirts of the meadow. But at this point,
wearied by such an unwonted burst of effort, the
King halted sulkily. He had not had an eye put out.
He wanted to give it up. But his mate came right
on, thirsting for her revenge.</p>
<p>The man was not content with her pursuit alone.
Spurting ahead, he gathered up two handfuls of sand
and gravel, whirled about, and drove them with all
his strength into the King&#8217;s cold eyes. It worked.
Smarting and half blinded, the monster forgot his
weariness, and came charging along furiously in the
trail of his mate.</p>
<p>They were stupid, these Lizard Kings, with more
brains in their pelvic arches than in their giant skulls.
Because the puny man-creature went stumbling almost
within reach of their beaks, they imagined they were
going to catch him. That he would go dodging around
thickets which they crashed over blindly, and would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
then return to present himself again deliberately before
them, did not strike them as at all suspicious. Their
dull but relentless hate once thoroughly aroused, as
long as he was in sight and they could move the mighty
columns of their legs, they would pursue him.</p>
<p>Through the last heavy fringe of bush and leafage
they pursued him, and with a great crashing of
branches came out upon the open, short-grass meadow.
Still the man-creature stumbled on, straight out into
the open, and still they followed, raging silently.</p>
<p>The black herds of the Dinoceras stopped feeding
all at once, and raised their vicious heads and
stared.</p>
<p>There were countless cows in the herd, horned like
the bulls, but smaller, and without the rending tusks.
The cows, at this season, all had young. After one
long, comprehending stare at the two gigantic mottled
shapes bearing down upon them, the herd put itself in
motion. The man-creature they hardly noticed, he
seemed so insignificant.</p>
<p>With eyes that took in everything, coolly and sagaciously,
the man observed that the motion of the herd
was an ordered one. The black beasts were deftly sorting
themselves out to meet the danger. The bulls came
thrusting themselves to the front&ndash;&ndash;a terrific array
which might have struck panic to the hearts of even
the colossal Dinosaurs had they not been too stupid
with rage for any new impression to pierce their brains.
The cows, meanwhile, pushing their calves into a huddled
mass behind them, formed themselves into a second
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
array, a reserve of less mass and strength than the
ranks of the bulls, but of an invincible mother-fury.</p>
<p>The man, with a wise fearlessness, ran on straight
through the gathering line of bulls, the nearest of whom
thrust at him carelessly and then paid him no more
heed. Behind their ranks, hidden now from the sight
of his pursuers, he swerved, avoiding the line of cows,
ran sharply to the right, and came back around the
end of the line to see what was going to happen. For
all his grief, his heart was thumping almost to suffocation
as his titanic vengeance moved to its end.</p>
<p>When the two raging Dinosaurs lost sight of their
prey they stopped short, stupidly bewildered. Then
they noticed the array of black beasts charging upon
them. This, in their mad mood, afforded a new
object to their rage. They plunged wallowing forward
to meet the new foe. And at that moment the
man, appearing round the wing of the black ranks,
halted abruptly, and laughed.</p>
<p>It was a strange, disconcerting sound, that laughter,
and the nearest Dinoceras, disturbed by it, edged away
and crowded against his neighbor&#8217;s flank in an inexplicable
apprehension.</p>
<p>The next moment the stupendous opposing forces
met with a shock that, to the man&#8217;s overstrung senses,
seemed to make the very daylight reel. There was
no space for evasion or man&oelig;uver. The two ponderous
bulks went straight through the ranks of the
black bulls, ripping them with beak and horn from
shoulder to rump, treading them down like corn, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
trampling them under foot as they rolled on. The
bulls on either side charged on their flanks, rearing,
grunting, squealing insanely and ripping with the
massive daggers of their tusks. But as this terrific
assault came from both sides at once, the two monsters
were in reality supported by it, so that they were
not swept off their feet. Almost without a check,
as it seemed, they ploughed straight on, lashing with
their mighty tails, and leaving a trail of disabled
victims behind them, and so wore their way right up
to the line of the cows.</p>
<p>But here they were stopped. The calves were behind
that line.</p>
<p>The black mothers simply heaped themselves upon
those impaling horns and armored fronts, bearing them
down, smothering, engulfing them in an avalanche of
screaming and monstrous bulks. The bulls, meanwhile,
were rending, tearing, stabbing, on flank and
rear. The two Dinosaurs disappeared from view.
The dreadful mountain of writhing, gigantic shapes
heaved convulsively for some minutes. Then the great
columns that were the Dinosaurs&#8217; legs seemed to
crumble beneath the weight. The awful, battling heap
sagged, fell apart, and let in the glare of the sunlight
upon what had been the two colossal monarchs of the
early world. The dreadful, unrecognizable things still
moved, still heaved and twisted ponderously among the
bodies of their slain, but it was mere aimless paroxysm,
the blind life struggling to resist its final expulsion and
dissipation. The wounded Dinoceras drew away, to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
die or recover as curious Nature might decree. The
surviving cows returned to assure themselves that their
young had come to no hurt. And the great black bulls
who had escaped serious injury in the struggle stood
about in a ring, thrusting and ripping at the unresponsive
mountains of flesh. As they satisfied themselves,
one after another, that the victory was complete, and
that there was nothing more to battle against, they fell
to devouring their prey. Ordinarily feeders on herbage
and roots, they were like pigs and rats and men,
more or less without prejudice in their diet, and they
seemed to think that dinosaur went very well with
grass.</p>
<p>At a distance of not more than fifty paces from these
destroying hosts, the man-creature stood carelessly, and
stared and considered. He had no fear of them. He
knew he could avoid them with ease. So insignificant
that in their excitement they hardly noticed him, so
small that in bulk he was no greater than the least
of their calves, he nevertheless despised the gigantic
beasts and felt himself their lord. He had played with
the two monarchs of all the early world, led them into
his trap, and taken such dreadful vengeance upon them
that his grief was almost assuaged by the fullness of
it. The black herds of the Dinoceras he had used as
the tools of his vengeance. No doubt, if necessary,
he could use them again in some such fashion.</p>
<p>He turned his back upon them, knowing that his
fine ear would inform him at once if any should take
it into their heads to pursue him, and stalked away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
with deliberation towards the wooded ground. But
he avoided his tree. He would never more go near
that empty home. He would return to the regions
beyond the head of the lagoon, where he would find
scattered members of his kindred. He would find
another mate; and in a dim, groping way he harbored
a desire for new offspring, for sons, in particular, who
should be inquiring and full of resource, like himself.
At the edge of the wood he turned, and gave one more
long, musing look at the invincible black herds whom
he had used. The idea of sons came back upon him
insistently. A faint sense of the immeasurable vastness
of what was to be done swept over his soul.
But he was not daunted. He would at least do something.
And he would teach his children, till they
should learn, perhaps, by taking thought, even to overcome
the ferocity of the saber-tooth and foil the malice
of the great red bear.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE FINDING OF FIRE</h3>
</div>
<p style='text-align:center;'>I</p>
<p>The people of the Little Hills were in extremity.
Trouble after trouble had come upon them, blow
after blow had stricken them, till now there were
but three score fighting-men, with perhaps twice that
number of women able to bear children, left to the
tribe. It looked as if but one more stroke such as
that which had just befallen them must wipe them out
of existence. And that, had ruthless Nature suffered
it, would have been a damage she might have taken
some thousands of years to repair. For the People of
the Little Hills had climbed higher from the pregnant
ooze than any other of the man or half-man tribes at
that time struggling into being on the youthful Earth.</p>
<p>First and not least formidable to the tribe had
been an incursion from the east of beings who were
plainly men, in a way, but still more plainly beasts.
Had the tribe of the Little Hills but known it, these
Ape-men were much like their own ancestors except
for the blackness of their skins beneath the coarse
fur, the narrow angle of their skulls and the heavy
forward thrust of their lower jaws.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, appearing from no man could say
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
just where, came a scattered incursion of mammoth
cave-bears, saber-toothed tigers and a few gigantic
cave-lions. These ravenous monsters not only
slaughtered wholesale the game on which the Hillmen
most depended, but strove&ndash;&ndash;each for himself, fortunately&ndash;&ndash;to
seize the caves. As they raged against
each other no less desperately than against their human
adversaries, the issue of the war was never in doubt.
The Hillmen stood together solidly, fought with all
their cunning of pitfall and ambuscade, and overwhelmed
the mightiest by sheer weight of numbers.
But again the victory was dearly bought. When the
last of the monsters, sullen and amazed, withdrew to
seek less difficult encounters, he left mourning and
lamentation in the caves.</p>
<p>This war had been a matter of some seasons. Then
had followed a summer of peace and good hunting,
which had given wounds time to heal. But with
winter had swept down another dreadful invasion
again from the unfriendly east&ndash;&ndash;wolves, wolves of
gigantic stature, and hunting in such huge packs that
many outlying sections of the tribe were cut off and
devoured before the Hillmen could combine to withstand
them. Fortunately, the different packs had no
combined action, so after the first shock the sagacious
warrior who ruled the men of the Little Hills was able
to get his diminished followers together, along with
most of their stored supplies, and mass them in the
amphitheater of the central caves.</p>
<p>So dragged by half the desperate winter. Then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
suddenly the wolves, having exterminated or driven
off all the game among the Little Hills, once more
took the trail, though with diminished ranks, and
swept off ravaging to the south-westward. The
People of the Little Hills were free once more to
come out into the sun. But there was no more game
to hunt, neither in the forest, nor on the upland slopes,
nor in the reeking marshes by the estuary. The tribe
was driven to fumbling in the pools at low tide for
scallops and clams and mussels, a diet which their
souls despised and their bodies resented.</p>
<p>The fact that the invasion of the wolves had forced
the tribe to concentrate, however, presently proved
to have been a painfully disguised blessing. Had they
remained as before, scattered all over their domain for
the convenience of the chase, their next and hardest
trial would surely have annihilated them.</p>
<p>It was once more out of the east that it came upon
them, by the trail of the vanished Ape-men and the
ravaging wolves. About sunrise of a summer&#8217;s day
a woman of the tribe was grubbing for roots with a
pointed stick by the banks of a brook when she was
pounced upon by a pair of squat, yellow-brown, filthy
men with enormous shoulders, short bow-legs and flat
faces with gaping, upturned nostrils. Young and
vigorous, she fought like a tigress till stunned by a
blow on the head, which was not before both her assailants
were streaming with blood from the jabs of
her sharp digging-stick. Her cries had aroused the
tribe, however, and her captors, appreciating in her a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
shapeliness and fairness beyond anything they had ever
seen in their own females, hastened to make sure of
their prize by dragging her off into the woods. Three
of the Hillmen, raging in pursuit, were intercepted by
a horde of the squat strangers suddenly leaping from
the thickets, surrounded, pulled down after a heaving
convulsion of struggle, torn to pieces and trodden into
the earth.</p>
<p>The Chief of the tribe, from his vantage at the
top of the slope which led up to the little amphitheater
of caves wherein he had gathered his people,
saw and understood. The perils of the past two years
had made him cool and provident. One look at those
foul and shaggy hordes, leaping like beasts, had told
him that this was to be a battle to the death. Angrily
beating back the hotheads who would have rushed
down to avenge their kin and inevitably to share their
fate, his shouts, bellowed sonorously from his deep
and hairy chest, called up the whole tribe to the defense
of the bottle-neck pass which led into the amphitheater.
At a word, passed on breathlessly from mouth to
mouth, the old men and the old women, with some of
the bigger children, swarmed up among the rocks
and ledges which formed the two walls of the pass,
while others raced about collecting stones to hand up to
them. The younger women and grown girls, armed,
like the men, with stone-headed clubs and flint-tipped
spears, took their places in the hinder ranks at the
mouth of the pass.</p>
<p>The Bow-legs, their yellow skin showing through the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
clotted tufts of coarse, clay-colored hair which unevenly
clothed their bodies, came plunging irregularly
through the brook and gathered in confused masses
along the foot of the slope, jabbering shrilly to each
other and making insolent gestures toward the silent
company at the top. The hair of their heads was
stringy, coarse and scant, and of an inky blackness, in
contrast to the abundant locks of the Hillmen, which
were for the most part of a dark brown or ruddy hue.</p>
<p>In other respects the contrast was still more striking,
the Hillmen, erect and straight, were taller than their
bestial-looking opponents by a foot or fifteen inches.
With less breadth of shoulder and heaviness of trunk,
they had great depth of chest, great muscular development
in arm and leg, and a leanness of flank that gave
them a look of breed. Their skins, very hairy in the
case of the mature men, were of a reddish-tan color,
paling to pink and cream in the children and younger
women. They had ample foreheads under the wild
thatch of their hair, and high, well-bridged noses, and
fierce, steady eyes of green, blue or brown-gray. Outnumbered
nearly ten to one, and shrewd enough to see
at a glance what ferocious power lurked in those misshapen
frames at the foot of the slope, they stood staring
down upon them in silence, with an undaunted
loathing.</p>
<p>For some minutes the hordes of the Bow-legs
clustered together, jabbering and waving their crude
but massive clubs excitedly. They seemed to have
no chief, no plan of attack, no discipline of any sort.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
Some of them even squatted down on the turf and
scratched themselves like monkeys, glaring malignantly
but stupidly at the little array of their opponents, and
snorting through their hideous upturned nostrils, which
were little more than wide, red pits in their faces.
Then some of those who were squatting on the ground
began to play with a dreadful red ball which had some
wisps of hair yet clinging to it.</p>
<p>A snarling roar went up from the ranks of the
Hillmen, and some of them would have rushed to
accept the ghastly challenge. But the Chief held them
back sternly. Then he himself, half a head taller
than all but one or two of his followers, with magnificent
chest and shoulders, and a dark, lionlike mane
thick-streaked with grey, strode out three or four paces
to the front and stood leaning on his huge, porphyry-headed
club while he glared down contemptuously over
the gesticulating horde.</p>
<p>The Bow-legs stilled their jabbering for a moment
to stare with interest at this imposing figure. Then
one of those who were seated on the ground seized
the ghastly ball that they were playing with, whirled
it by the hair and hurled it two-thirds of the way up
the slope. As it fell and rebounded, two young women
sprang from the ranks, their thick locks streaming like
a cloud behind them, and dashed down the hill to meet
it. The foremost caught it up, clutched it to her
naked breast, and screamed a curse upon the gaping
murderers. Then the two fled back, and were lost
in the ranks of the Hillmen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>The sight of the two women, with their bright skins,
their strong, straight limbs and their rich, floating hair,
appeared to give the Bow-legs just the spur to concerted
action that they were needing. They rightly
judged there were more of those desirable beings in
the crowd behind that tall, contemptuous chief. Those
on the ground scrambled eagerly to their feet, and with
shrill, bestial yells the whole horde charged up the slope.</p>
<p>As the leaping and hideous forms approached the
top the pent-up fury of the Hillmen, in spite of all
the Chief could do, broke loose, and with a roar the
foremost ranks bounded forth to meet them. At the
first crash of contact the enemy were crushed back, the
stone-headed clubs and flint-tipped spears working
havoc in the reeking masses. But, as the Chief had
foreseen it would be, that forward rush was a mistake,
exposing the flanks; and sheer weight of numbers
presently forced the Hillmen back till their front was
once more level with the jaws of the pass. Here,
however, with their flanks protected, they were solid
as a wall of granite.</p>
<p>Upon this narrow wall the yelling wave of the
attack surged and recoiled, and surged again, and made
no impression. The clumsy weapons of the enemy
were no match for the pounding swing of the stone
clubs, the long, lightning thrust of the flint-headed
spears. But the Bow-legs, their little pig-eyes red
with lust for their prey, fought with a sort of frenzy,
diving in headlong and clutching at the legs of the
Hillmen with their ape-like, sinewy arms, dragging them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
down and tearing then with crooked, clawlike fingers.</p>
<p>Many of the Hillmen, and some women died in this
way. But no woman was dragged away alive; for
if this fate threatened her, and rescue was impossible,
she was instantly speared from her own ranks to save
her from a fate which would have dishonored the
tribe. And the women indeed, in this battle were no
less formidable than the men themselves, for they
fought with the swift venom of the she-wolf, the
cunning fury of the mad heifer, intuitive and implacable.
Their instincts of motherhood, the safeguard
of the future, made them loathe with a blind, unspeakable
hate these filthy and bestial males who threatened
to father their children.</p>
<p>The center of the Hillmen&#8217;s front was securely held
by the great Chief, whose massive club, wielded with
the art acquired in many battles, kept a space cleared
before him across which no foe could pass alive.
As his followers went down on either side, others from
the ranks behind stepped eagerly into the gaps. At
the extreme left, where the walls of the pass, lower
and less abrupt than on the right, invited an attack
as fierce as that upon the center, the defense was led
by a warrior named Gr&ocirc;m, who seemed no less redoubtable
than the Chief himself. He, too, like the
Chief, fought in grim silence, saving his breath, except
for an occasional incisive cry of command or encouragement
to those about him. And his club also,
like that of the Chief, kept a zone of death before him.</p>
<p>But his club was much smaller than that shattering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
mace of porphyry wielded by the Chief&ndash;&ndash;smaller
and lighter, considerably longer in the handle and
quite of another pattern. The head was of flint, a
sort of ragged cone set sideways into the handle, so
that one end of the head was like a sledge-hammer
and the other like a pick. Grasping this neat weapon
nearly half-way up the handle, he made miraculous
play with it, now smashing with the hammer front,
now tapping with the pick, now suddenly swinging
it out to the full length of the long handle to reach
and drop an elusive adversary. The weapon was
both club and spear to him; and to guard against any
possibility of its being wrenched from him in the
m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, he held it secured to his wrist by a thong of
hide.</p>
<p>This warrior, though his renown in the tribe, both
as hunter and fighter, was second only to that of the
great Chief himself, had never aroused the Chief&#8217;s
jealousy. This for several reasons. He had always
loyally supported the Chief&#8217;s authority, instead of
scheming to undermine it, and his influence had always
made for tribal discipline. He was not so tall as the
Chief, by perhaps half a handbreadth, and for all his
huge muscles of arm and breast he was altogether of a
slimmer build; wherefore the Chief, while vastly respecting
his counsels, was not suspicious of his rivalry.
Moreover, up to the time of the invasion of the wolves,
he had always dwelt in a remote cave, quite on the
outskirts of the tribe, constituting himself a frontier
defense, as it were, and avoiding all the tribal gossip.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
Slightly younger than the Chief, and with few gray
streaks as yet in the dense, ruddy-brown masses of his
hair and beard, his face nevertheless looked older, by
reason of its deeper lines and the considering gravity
of the eyes.</p>
<p>In his remote cave Gr&ocirc;m had had the companionship
of his family, consisting of his old mother, his
two wives, and his four children&ndash;&ndash;three sons and a
daughter. It was while he was absent on a hunting
expedition that the wolves had come. They had surprised
the little, isolated family, and after a terrible
struggle wiped it out.</p>
<p>Conspicuous among the fighters at Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s back was
a young girl, tall, with a fair skin and masses of
long, very dark hair. Armed with a spear, she fought
savagely, but at the same time managed to keep an
eye on all the warrior&#8217;s movements.</p>
<p>Suddenly from the rocks above came a shrill cry.
To Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s ears it seemed like the voice of one of his
dead children. At the end of a long stroke, when his
arms and the club were outstretched full length, he
glanced upwards in spite of himself. Instantly the
club was clutched by furious hands. He was pulled
forward. At the same time one of the enemy, ducking
under his arms, plunged between his legs. And he
came down upon his face.</p>
<p>With a piercing scream, the tall girl bounded forth
and stood across him; and her spear stabbed his nearest
assailant straight through the flat and grinning face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
So lightning swift was the rage of her attack that for
one vital moment it held the whole horde at bay. Then
the Hillmen swarmed forward irresistibly, battered
down the foremost of the foe, and dragged the fallen
warrior back behind the lines to recover. In half a
minute he was once more at the front, fighting with renewed
fury, his head and back and shoulders covered
with blood. And close behind him stood the girl,
breathless, clutching at her heart and staring at him
with wide eyes, unaware that the blood which covered
him was not his but her own.</p>
<p>Although to the invaders, their every charge broken
and hurled back with terrific slaughter, it must have
seemed that their tall opponents had all the best of
the battle, to the wise old men and women up among
the rocks it was clear that their warriors were being
rapidly worn away as a bank is eaten by the waves.
But now from a high ledge on the right, where the
wall of the pass was a sheer perpendicular, came two
shrill whistles. It was a signal which the Chief, now
bleeding from many wounds, had been waiting for.
He roared a command, and his ranks, after one surge
forward to recover their wounded, gave back sullenly
till their front was more than half-way down the pass.
With yells of triumph the Bow-legs followed, trampling
their dead and wounded, till the bottle-neck was
packed so tightly that there was no room to move.</p>
<p>From the left wall a ceaseless shower of stones
came down upon their heads; but from the right, for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
a few moments, only a rain of pebbles and dust, which
blinded them and choked their hideous, upturned
nostrils.</p>
<p>Above that dust a band of graybeards heaved upon
a lever. They grunted and strained, with eyes staring
and the sweat jumping forth on their foreheads. Then
something gave. A great slice of the rock-face began
to slip. Some of the toilers scrambled back to safety,
their long, white hair flying behind them. But others,
unable to recover themselves in time, fell sprawling
forward. Then with a thunderous growl a huge slab
of rock and earth and d&eacute;bris crashed down upon the
packed hordes in the neck of the pass. A long shout
of triumph went up from the Hillmen. The outer
ranks of the invaders stood for a second or two
petrified with horror. Then they turned and fled,
screaming, down the slope. On their heels the Hillmen
pursued, slaughtering, till the brook-bed was
choked with the dead. Of that filthy horde hardly
a score escaped, and these fled back, gibbering, to meet
the migrant hosts of their kin who were following on
their trail. The story they told was of a tribe of tall,
fair-skinned demons, invincible in war, who tore up
mountains to hurl them on their adversaries. And
thereafter, for a time, the Bow-legged hosts changed
the path of their migration, sweeping far to the southward
to avoid the land of the Little Hills.</p>
<p style='text-align:center;margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1em;'>II</p>
<p>A white, high-sailing moon streamed down into
the amphitheater, where the scarred remnant of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
tribe of the Little Hills, squatting before their cave-mouths,
took counsel. Their dead had all been reverently
buried, under heaps of stones, on the bare
and wind-swept shoulder of the downs. Outside the
pass the giant jackals, cave-hyenas and other
scavengers of the night, howled and scuffled over the
carcasses of the slain invaders.</p>
<p>Endless and tumultuous was the talk, the white-haired,
bent old men and the women who had borne
children being listened to as attentively as the warriors.
The Chief, sitting on a rock which raised him above
the rest, spoke only a word now and then, but gave
ear to all, glancing from speaker to speaker with narrowed
eyes, weighing all suggestions. On the outskirts
of the circle stood Gr&ocirc;m, leaning on his club,
staring at the moon, apparently lost in dreams.</p>
<p>Suddenly the Chief uttered a sharp word, and the
tribe fell silent. He rose, yet stiff from his wounds,
and, towering masterfully over the council announced
his decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have heard much foolishness,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but also
some wisdom. And the greatest wisdom has come
from the lips of my father yonder, Alp the old.&#8221; He
pointed to a decrepit figure, whose bowed head was
hidden under a mass of white hair. &#8220;My father&#8217;s
eyes are blind with age,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;but behind
their darkness they see many things that we cannot see.
They have seen that all these disasters which have
lately come upon us have come out of the east. They
see that there must be a reason. They see that other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
terrible dangers must also be coming out of the east,
and that we People of the Little Hills lie in their
path. How many more can we withstand, and live?
Not one more. Therefore, I say we will leave this
place, this home of our fathers, and we will go toward
the setting sun, and find a new home far from our
enemies till we can grow strong again. I have said
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he sat down there was a low murmur, many
thinking he was right; while others, not daring to
dissent quite openly, yet were angry and afraid at the
idea of leaving their familiar dwellings. But Gr&ocirc;m,
who had turned on his club and listened to the Chief
with shining eyes, now stepped forward into the circle
and spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bawr is our Chief,&#8221; said he, in a clear, calm voice;
&#8220;not only because he is our mightiest in war, but because
he is also our wisest in counsel. When do we
go?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Chief thought for a moment. For the murmurs
of the dissidents he cared nothing, having made up
his mind. But he was glad of Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s support.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two moons hence,&#8221; he answered presently. &#8220;Our
wounded must be healed, for we must be strong on
the journey. And as we go far, and know not where
we go, we must gather much food to carry with us.
When the moon is twice again full, we leave these caves
and the Land of the Little Hills.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Gr&ocirc;m, &#8220;if Bawr will allow me, I will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
go and find a place for us, and come again quickly
and lead the tribe thither by the shortest way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is good!&#8221; said Bawr, quick to see what dangerous
wanderings might be spared to the tribe by this
plan. &#8220;When will you go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In to-morrow&#8217;s morning-red,&#8221; answered Gr&ocirc;m.</p>
<p>At Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s words, the young girl, A-ya, who had
been watching the warrior where he stood aloof, sprang
to her feet in sharp agitation and clutched her dark
hair to her bosom in two great handfuls. At this a
huge youth, who had been squatting as close as possible
to the girl, and eyeing her averted face greedily, jumped
up with a jealous scowl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gr&ocirc;m is a traitor!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;He deserts us in
our need. Let him not go, Chief!&#8221;</p>
<p>A growl of protest went up from his hearers. The
girl faced round upon him with blazing eyes. Gr&ocirc;m
gave him an indifferent glance, and turned away, half
smiling. The Chief struck the rock with his club,
and said coldly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mawg is young, and his words are foolish. Gr&ocirc;m
is a true man. He shall do as he will.&#8221;</p>
<p>The youth&#8217;s heavy features worked angrily for a
moment as he sought words for a further attack.
Then his face smoothed into a grin as he remembered
that from so perilous a venture it was most unlikely
his rival would ever return. He gave a crafty side-glance
at the girl, and sat down again, while she turned
her back upon him. At a sign from the Chief the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
council broke up, and all slipped off, chattering, into
their caves.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>As the first pink light crept up the sky, Gr&ocirc;m set
forth on his mysterious venture. It was just such a
venture as his sanguine and inquiring spirit, avid of
the unknown, had always dreamed of. But never
before had he had such an object before him as seemed
to justify the long risk. There was all a boy&#8217;s eagerness
in his deep eyes, under their shaggy brows, as
he slipped noiselessly out of the bottle-neck, picked
his way lightly over the well-gnawed bones of the
slain invaders, turned his back on the sunrise, and took
his course up the edge of the stream. The weapons
he carried were his war-club, two light, flint-headed
hunting-spears and a flint knife hung from his wolf-skin
girdle.</p>
<p>All that day, till mid-afternoon, he journeyed
swiftly, straight ahead, taking no precaution save to
keep always a vigilant watch and to avoid dark coverts
whence tiger or leopard might spring upon him.
He was in a region which he had often hunted over,
and where he felt at home. He traveled very swiftly,
at a long, noiseless lope; and when he wished to rest
he climbed into a tree for security.</p>
<p>Several times during the day he had had a sensation
of being followed; and, turning quickly, he had
run back, in the hope of detecting his pursuer. But
when he found no one, he concluded that it was
merely one of the ghosts the tribe so feared, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
whom he himself rather held in contempt as futile.</p>
<p>Long before noon he had forsaken the brook, because
its course had ceased to lead him westward. In
the afternoon he reached a river which marked the
limit of his former explorations. It was a wide, swift
water, but too shallow and turbulent for swimming,
and he forded it with some difficulty. Once across,
he went with more caution, oppressed with a sense of
strangeness, although the landscape as yet was in no
way greatly changed.</p>
<p>As the sun got low, Gr&ocirc;m cast about for a safe tree
in whose top to pass the perilous hours of dark. As
he stared around him a cry of fear came from the
bunch of woods which he had just quitted. The voice
was a woman&#8217;s. He ran back. The next second the
trees parted, and a girl came rushing towards him, her
dark hair streaming behind her. Close after her came
three huge cave-wolves.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m shouted, and hurled a spear. It struck one
of the wolves full in the chest, splitting the heart. At
this the other two halted irresolutely. But as Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s
tall figure came bounding down upon them, their indecision
vanished. They wheeled about, and ran off
into the thickets. The girl came forward timorously,
and knelt at Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s feet.</p>
<p>At first with wonder and some annoyance, the
warrior looked down upon her. Then recognition
came into his eyes. He saw the tip of a deep wound
on her shoulder, and knew that it ran, livid and angry,
half-way down her bosom. It was the young girl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
A-ya. His eyes softened, for he had heard how it was
she who had saved him in the battle, fighting so furiously
over him when he was down&ndash;&ndash;she in whose blood
he had found his shoulders bathed. Yet up to that time
he had never noticed her, his mind being full of other
matters than women. Now he looked at her and
wondered. He was sorely afraid of being hampered
in his great enterprise, but he asked her gently why
she had followed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was afraid for you,&#8221; she answered, without
looking up. &#8220;You go to such great dangers. I could
not stay with the tribe, and wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think I need help?&#8221; he asked, with a self-confident
look in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You did need me in the battle!&#8221; answered the girl
proudly.</p>
<p>&#8220;True!&#8221; said Gr&ocirc;m. &#8220;But for you I should now
have been sleeping under the stones and the wind.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at her with a feeling that surprised himself,
a kind of thrilling tenderness, such as he had
never felt toward a woman before. His wives had
been good wives and dutiful, and he had been content
with them. But it occurred to him that neither of
them would ever have thought to come with him on
this expedition.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not stay without you,&#8221; said the girl again.
&#8220;Also, I was afraid of Mawg,&#8221; she added cunningly.</p>
<p>A wave of jealous wrath surged through Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s
veins.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Mawg had troubled you, I would have killed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
him!&#8221; said he fiercely. And, snatching the girl to
her feet, he crushed her for a moment vehemently to
his great breast.</p>
<p>&#8220;But why,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;did you follow me so
secretly all day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was afraid you would be angry, and send me
back,&#8221; she answered, with a sigh of content.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not have sent you back,&#8221; said Gr&ocirc;m, his
indifference quite forgotten. &#8220;But come, we must find
a place for the night.&#8221;</p>
<p>And hand in hand they ran to a great tree which
Gr&ocirc;m had already marked for his retreat. As they
climbed to the upper branches, dusk fell quickly about
them, some great beast roared thunderously from the
depths of the forest, and from a near-by jungle came
sudden crashings of the undergrowth.</p>
<p style='text-align:center;margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1em;'>III</p>
<p>For three weeks Gr&ocirc;m and the girl pressed on
eagerly, swinging north to avoid a vast lake, whose
rank and marshy shores were trodden by monsters such
as they had never before set eyes upon. Of nights,
no matter how high or how well hidden their tree-top
refuge might be, they found it necessary to keep vigil
turn and turn about, so numerous and so enterprising
were the enemies who sought to investigate the strange
human trail.</p>
<p>Had Gr&ocirc;m been alone he would soon have been worn
out for want of sleep. The girl, however, her eyes
ever bright with happiness, seemed utterly untiring, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
Gr&ocirc;m watched her with daily growing delight. He had
never heard or dreamed of a man regarding a woman
as he regarded the lithe, fierce creature who ran beside
him. But he had never been afraid of new things or
new ideas, and he was not ashamed of this sweet ache
of tenderness at his astonished heart.</p>
<p>Beyond the lake and the morasses they came to a
strange, broken land, a land of fertile valleys, deep-verdured
and teeming with life, but sown with abrupt,
conelike, naked hills. Along the near horizon ran a
chain of those sharp, low summits, irregularly jagged
against the pale blue. From several of the summits
rose streamers of murky vapor; and one of these,
darker and more abundant than the others, spread
abroad at the top on the windless air till it took the
shape of a colossal pine-tree. To the girl the sight
was portentous. It filled her with apprehension, and
she would have liked to avoid this unfamiliar-looking
region. But, seeing that Gr&ocirc;m was filled with interest
at the novel phenomena before them, she thrust aside
her fears and assumed a like eagerness on the subject.</p>
<p>In the heat of the day they came to a pair of trees,
lofty and spreading, which stood a little apart from
the rest of the forest growth, in a stretch of open
meadows. An ice-cold rivulet babbled past their roots.
It was time for the noonday rest, and these trees seemed
to offer a safe retreat. The girl drank, splashed herself
with the delicious coolness, flung back her dripping
hair, then swung herself up lightly into the
branches. Gr&ocirc;m lingered a few moments below, letting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
the water trickle down and over his great muscles
by handfuls. Then he threw himself down upon his
face and drank deep.</p>
<p>While he was in this helpless position&ndash;&ndash;his sleepless
vigilance for the moment at fault&ndash;&ndash;from behind
a near-by thicket rushed a gigantic, shaggy grey form,
and hurled itself at him ponderously but with awful
swiftness, like a grey bowlder dashing down a hillside.
The girl, from her perch in the lower branches,
gave a shriek of warning. Gr&ocirc;m bounded to his feet,
and darted for the tree. But the monster&ndash;&ndash;a gray
bear, of a bulk beyond that of the hugest grizzly&ndash;&ndash;was
almost upon him, and would have seized him
before he could climb out of reach. A spear hurtled
close past his head. It grazed, and laid open, the side
of the beast&#8217;s snout, and sank deep into its shoulder.
With a roar, the beast halted to claw it forth. And in
that moment Gr&ocirc;m swung himself up into the branches,
dropping both his spears as he did so.</p>
<p>The bear, mad with pain and fury, reared himself
against the trunk and began to draw himself up.
Gr&ocirc;m struck at him with his club, but from his difficult
position could put no force into his blow
and the bear hardly seemed to notice it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must lead him up, then drop down and run,&#8221;
said Gr&ocirc;m. And the two mounted nimbly.</p>
<p>The bear followed, till the branches began to yield
too perilously beneath his weight. Then Gr&ocirc;m and
the girl slipped over into the next tree. As they did so
another bear even huger than the first, and apparently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
her mate, appeared below, glanced up with shrewd, implacable
eyes, and proceeded to climb the second tree.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m looked at the girl with piercing anxiety such
as he had never known before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you run, very fast?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>The girl laughed, her terror almost forgotten in
her pride at having once more saved him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ran from the wolves,&#8221; she reminded him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we must run, perhaps very far,&#8221; answered
Gr&ocirc;m, reassured, &#8220;till we find some place of steep rocks
where we can fight with some hope. For these beasts
are obstinate, and will never give up from pursuing us.
And, unlike the red cave-bears they seem to know how
to climb trees.&#8221;</p>
<p>When both bears were high in the two trees, Gr&ocirc;m
and the girl slipped down by the bending tips of the
branches, almost as swiftly as falling. They snatched
up Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s two spears and A-ya&#8217;s broken one, and ran,
down along the brook toward the line of the smoking
hills. The bears, descending more slowly, came after
them at a terrific, ponderous gallop.</p>
<p>The girl ran, as she had said, well&ndash;&ndash;so well that
Gr&ocirc;m who was famous in the tribe for his running,
did not have greatly to slacken his pace in her favor.
Finding that, at first, they gained slightly on their pursuers,
Gr&ocirc;m bade her slow down a little till they did
no more than hold their own. Fearing lest she should
exhaust herself, he ran always a pace behind her,
admonishing her how to save her strength and her
breath, and ever warily casting his eyes about for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
possible refuge. Warily, too, he chose the smoothest
ways, sparing her feet. For he knew that if she gave
out and fell he would stop and fight his last fight over
her body.</p>
<p>For an hour or more the girl ran easily. Then she
began to show signs of distress. Her face grew ashen,
the breath came harshly from her open lips, and once
or twice she stumbled. With the first pang of fear
at his heart, Gr&ocirc;m closed up beside her, made her lean
heavily on his rigid forearm, and cheered her with
words of praise. He pointed to a spur of broken
mountains now close ahead, with a narrow valley cleaving
them midway.</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be ledges,&#8221; he said, &#8220;where we can defend
ourselves, and where you can rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Skirting a bit of jungle, so dense with massive cane
and thorned creepers that nothing could penetrate it,
they came suddenly upon a space of barren gray plain,
and saw, straight ahead, the opening of the valley. It
was not more than a couple of furlongs distant. And
its walls, partly clothed with shrubbery, partly naked,
were so seamed and cleft and creviced that they appeared
to promise many convenient retreats. But
across the mouth of the valley extended an appalling
barrier. From an irregular fissure in the parched
earth, running on a slant from one wall to the other,
came tongues of red flame, waving upwards to a height
of several feet, sinking back, rising again, and bowing
as if in some enchanted dance.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s heart stood still in awe and amazement,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
and for a second he paused. The girl shut her eyes
in unspeakable terror, and her knees gave way beneath
her. As she sank, Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s spirit rose to the emergency.
The bears were now almost upon them. He jerked
the girl violently to her feet, and spoke to her in a
voice that brought her back to herself. Dragging her
by the wrist, he ran on straight for the barrier. The
girl, obedient to his order, shrank close to his side
and ran on bravely, keeping her eyes upon the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they are gods, those bright, dancing things,&#8221;
said Gr&ocirc;m, with a confidence he was far from feeling,
&#8220;they will save us. If they are devils, I will
fight them.&#8221;</p>
<p>A little to the right appeared a gap in the leaping
barrier, an opening some fifty feet across. Gr&ocirc;m made
for the center of this opening. The fissure here was
not more than three feet in width. The runners took
it in their stride. But a fierce heat struck up from it.
It filled the girl with such horror that her senses failed
her utterly. She ran on blindly a dozen paces more,
then reeled and fell in a swoon. Before her body
touched the ground, Gr&ocirc;m had swung her up into his
arms, but as he did so he looked back.</p>
<p>The bears were no longer pursuing. A spear&#8217;s-throw
back they had stopped, growling and whining,
and swaying their mountainous forms from side to
side in angry irresolution.</p>
<p>&#8220;They fear the bright, dancing things,&#8221; said Gr&ocirc;m
to himself; and added, with a throb of exultation,
&#8220;which I do not fear.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></p>
<p>Noticing for the first time in his excitement that
the ground, here parched and bare, was uncomfortably
hot beneath his feet, he carried his burden a few rods
further on, to where the green began again, and laid
her down on the thick herbage. Then he turned to
see what the bears were going to do.</p>
<p>Seeing that their intended prey made no further
effort to flee, the two monsters grew still more excited.
For a moment Gr&ocirc;m thought they would dare the
passage of the barrier, but he was reassured to see
that the flames filled them with an insuperable fear.
They dared not come nearer than the thin edges of
the verdure. At last, as if the same notion had struck
them both at once, they whirled about simultaneously,
made off among the dense thickets to the right, and
disappeared.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m knew far too well the obstinate vindictiveness
of their kind to think that they had given
up the chase; but, feeling safe for the present, and
seeing that the girl, recovered from her swoon, was
sitting up and staring with awed eyes at the line of
fire, he turned all his attention to these mysterious,
shining, leaping shapes to which they owed their escape.</p>
<p>With an attitude of deference, yet carrying both club
and spear in readiness, he slowly approached the
barrier, at the point where the flames were lowest and
least imposing. Their heat made him very uneasy,
but under the eyes of the girl he would show no sign
of fear. At a distance of six or eight feet he stopped,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
studying the thin, upcurling tongues of brightness.
Their heat, at this distance, was uncomfortable to his
naked flesh, but as he stood there wondering and took
no further hurt, his confidence grew. At length he
dared to stretch out his spear-tip and touch the flames,
very respectfully. The green-hide thongs which bound
the flint to the wood smoked, shriveled and hissed.
He withdrew the weapon in alarm, and examined the
tip. It was blackened, and hot to the touch. But,
seeing that the bright dancers had taken no notice, he
repeated the experiment. Several times he repeated
it, deeply pondering, while the girl, from her place
at the edge of the grass, stared with the wide eyes of
a child.</p>
<p>At last, though the green thongs still held, the dry
wood burst into flame. Startled to find that when he
drew the point back he brought a portion of the shining
creature with it, Gr&ocirc;m dashed the weapon down upon
the ground. The flame, insufficiently started, flickered
and died. But it left a spark, winking redly on the
blackened wood. Audacious in his consuming curiosity,
Gr&ocirc;m touched it with his finger. It stung smartly,
and Gr&ocirc;m snatched back his finger with an exclamation
of alarm. But by that touch the spark itself was
extinguished. That was an amazing thing. Sucking
his finger, Gr&ocirc;m stood gazing down at the spear-tip,
which had but now been so bright, and was now so
black. Plainly, it was a victory for him. He did
not understand it. But at least the Mysterious Ones
were not invincible, however much the bears feared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
them. Well, he did not fear them, he said proudly in
his heart. Aloud he said to A-ya:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Shining Dancers are our friends, but they do
not like to be touched. If you touch them, they bite.&#8221;</p>
<p>His heart swelled with a vast, unformulated hope.
Ideas, possibilities which he could not yet grasp, seethed
in his brain. Dimly, but overpoweringly, he realized
that he had passed the threshold of a new world. He
picked up the spear and turned to renew his experiments.</p>
<p>This time he let the fire take well hold upon the
spear-tip before he withdrew it. Then he held it upright,
burning like a torch. As he gazed at it raptly
a scream from the girl aroused him. She had sprung
to her feet and stood staring behind her, not knowing
which way to run because of her fear of the fire.
And there, not twenty paces from her, their giant grey
bulks half emerging from the thicket, stood the bears,
slavering in their fury but afraid to come nearer the
flame.</p>
<p>With a shout, Gr&ocirc;m darted at them, and the wind
of his going fanned his spear-point to a fierce blaze.
The girl screamed again at the sight, but bravely stood
her ground. The bears shrank, growled, then turned
and fled. With a dozen leaps Gr&ocirc;m was upon them.
The flame was already licking up the spear-shaft almost
to his grip. With all his force he threw, and the flint
tip buried itself in the nearest monster&#8217;s haunch. The
long fur blazed, and, in a frenzy of terror, the great
beasts went crashing off through the coverts. The fire
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
was speedily whipped out by the branches, but their
panic was uncontrollable; and long after they had
passed out of sight the sounds of their wild flight could
be followed. Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s heart came near bursting with exultation,
but he disdained to show it. He turned to
the girl, and said quietly: &#8220;They will not come back.&#8221;
And the girl threw herself at his feet in adoration.</p>
<p>And now for hours Gr&ocirc;m sat motionless, pondering,
pondering, and watching the line of flames with deep
eyes. The girl did not dare to interrupt his thoughts.
With the going of the sun came a chill breeze drawing
down from the ridges. Gr&ocirc;m rose, led the girl nearer
the flames, and reseated himself. As the girl realized
the kindly and comforting warmth her fears diminished.
She laughed softly, turned her shapely body round and
round in the glow, and then curled herself up like a cat
at Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s knees.</p>
<p>At last Gr&ocirc;m arose once more. Picking up his remaining
spear, he approached the fire with decision,
and thrust the butt, instead of the tip, into the flame.
When it was well alight, he thrust it down upon a tuft
of withered grass. The stuff caught at once, blazed
up and died out. Then Gr&ocirc;m rolled the burning spear-butt
on the earth till it, too, was quite extinguished.
The sparks still winking in the grass he struck with
his palm. They stung him, but they perished. He
drew himself up to his full height, turned to the girl
and stretched out his blackened hand. The girl sprang
to her feet, thrilled and wondering.</p>
<p>&#8220;See,&#8221; said Gr&ocirc;m, &#8220;I have made the bright Dancing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
Ones my servants. The tribe shall come here. And
we shall be the masters of all things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once more the girl threw herself at his feet. He
seemed to her a god. But remembering how she had
twice saved his life, she laid her cheek against his knee.
He lifted her into the hollow of his great arm, and she
leaned against him, gazing up into his face, while he
stood staring into the fire, his eyes clouded with visions.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>THE CHILDREN OF THE SHINING ONE</h3>
</div>
<p style='text-align:center;'>I</p>
<p>From the lip of the narrow volcanic fissure, which
ran diagonally two-thirds of the way across the
mouth of the valley, the line of fire waved and flickered
against the gathering dark. Sometimes only a few
inches high, sometimes sinking suddenly out of sight,
and then again as suddenly leaping up to a height of
five or six feet, the thin, gaseous flames danced elvishly.
Now clear yellow, now fiery orange, now of an almost
invisible violet, they shifted, and bowed their crests,
and thrust out shooting tongues, till Gr&ocirc;m, sitting on
his haunches and staring with fascinated eyes, had no
choice but to believe that they were live things like
himself. The girl, curled up at his side like a cat,
paid little attention to the marvel of the flames. Her
big, dark eyes, wild and furtive under the dark, tangled
masses of her hair, kept wandering back and forth
between the man&#8217;s brooding face and the obscure black
thickets which filled the valley behind him. The dancing
flames she did not understand, but she understood
the ponderous crashing, and growls, and savage cries
which came from those black thickets and slopes of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
tumbled rocks. The man being absorbed in watching
the wonders of the flames, and apparently all-forgetful
of the perils prowling back there in the dark, it was
plainly her duty to keep watch.</p>
<p>From time to time Gr&ocirc;m would drag his eyes away
from their contemplation of the flames to study intently
the charred spots on his club and the burned,
blackened end of his spear. He looked down at the
lithe figure of the watching girl, and laid a great,
hairy hand on her shoulder in a musing caress, as if
appraising her, and delighting in her, and finding in
her a mate altogether to his desire, although but a
child to his inmost thoughts. But those sounds of
menace from the darkness behind him he affected not
to hear at all. He could see from the girl&#8217;s eyes that
the menace was not yet close at hand; and since he had
learned the power of the fire, and his own mastery
over that power, he felt himself suddenly little less
than a god. The fire was surely something of a god;
and if he had any measure of control over the fire, so
as to make it serve him surely, then still more of the
god was there in his own intelligence. His heart
swelled with a pride such as he had never before conceived,
and his brain seethed with vague but splendid
possibilities. Never before had he, though at heart
the bravest of his brave clan, been able to listen to the
terrible voices of the cave-bear, the cave-hyena, or the
saber-tooth without fear, without the knowledge that
his own safety lay in flight. Now he feared them not
at all.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>A louder roaring came out of the shadows,
closer than before, and he saw A-ya&#8217;s eyes dilate as
she clutched at his knee. A slow smile spread across
his bony face, and he turned about, rising to his feet
as he did so, and lifting the girl with him.</p>
<p>With a new, strange warmth at his heart he realized
how fully the girl trusted him, how cool and steady
was her courage. For there, along the edge of the
lighted space, glaring forth from the fringes of the
thickets, were the monstrous beasts whom man had
most cause to dread. Nearest, his whole tawny length
emerging from the brush, crouched a giant saber-tooth
with the daggers of his tusks, ten inches long,
agleam in the light of the dancing flames. He was not
more than thirty or forty paces distant, and his tail
twitched heavily from side to side as if he were trying
to nerve himself up to a closer approach to the fire.
Some twenty paces further along the fringe of mingled
light and shadow, their bodies thrust half way forth
from the undergrowth, stood a pair of huge, ruddy
cave-bears, their monstrous heads held low and swaying
surlily from side to side as they eyed the prey which
they dared not rush in and seize. The man-animal
they had hitherto regarded as easy prey, and they
were filled with rage at the temerity of these two
humans in remaining so near the dreaded flames. Intent
upon them, they paid no heed to their great enemy,
the saber-toothed, with whom they were at endless
and deadly feud. Away off to the left, quite clear of
the woods, but safely remote from the fire, a pack of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
huge cave-hyenas sat up on their haunches, their long,
red tongues hanging out. With jaws powerful enough
to crack the thigh-bones of the urus, they nevertheless
hesitated to obtrude themselves on the notice either
of the crouching saber-tooth or of the two giant bears.</p>
<p>With neither the bears nor the great hyenas did
Gr&ocirc;m anticipate any trouble. But he felt it barely
possible that the saber-tooth might dare a rush in.
Snatching up a dry branch, and leading the girl with
him by the wrist, he backed slowly nearer the flames.
Terrified at their dancing and the scorching of their
breath, the girl sank down on her naked knees and
covered her face with her hair. Smiling at her terror,
Gr&ocirc;m thrust the branch into the flames. When it was
all ablaze he raised it above his head, and, carrying his
spear in his right hand, he rushed at the saber-tooth.
For a few seconds the monster faced his approach,
but Gr&ocirc;m saw the shrinking in his furious eyes, and
came on fearlessly. At last the beast whipped about
with a screeching snarl, and raced back into the woods.
Then Gr&ocirc;m turned to the bears, but they had not stayed
to receive his attentions. The sight of the flames
bursting, as it seemed, from the man&#8217;s shaggy head as
he ran, was too much for them, and they had slunk
back discreetly into the shadows.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m threw the blazing stick on the ground, laid
several more branches upon it, and presently had a
fine fire of his own going. He seized a small branch
and hurled it at the hyenas, sending them off with their
tails between their legs to their hiding-places on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
ragged slopes. Then he fed his fire with more dry
wood till the fierce heat of it drove him back. Returning
to the side of the wondering girl, he sat down,
and contemplated his handiwork with swelling pride.
When the flames died down he piled on more branches
till they blazed again to the height of the nearest tree-tops.
This he repeated, thoughtfully, several times,
till he had assured himself of his power to make this
bright, devouring god great or little at his pleasure.</p>
<p>This stupendous fact established clearly, Gr&ocirc;m
brought an armful of grass and foliage, and made
the girl take her sleep. He himself continued for an
hour or two his experiments with the fire, building
small ones in a circle about him, discovering that green
branches would not burn well, and brooding with knit
brows over each new center of light and heat which
he created.</p>
<p>Then, seated on his haunches beside the sleeping
A-ya, he pondered on the future of his tribe, on the
change in its fortunes which this mysterious new creature
was bound to bring about. At last, when the
night was half worn through, he awakened the girl,
bade her keep sharp watch, and threw himself down to
sleep, indifferent to the roars, and snarls, and dreadful
cries which came from the darkness of the upper
valley.</p>
<p>The valley looked straight into the east. When
the sun rose, its unclouded, level rays paled the dancing
barrier of flames almost to invisibility. Refreshed
by their few hours&#8217; sleep in the vital warmth, Gr&ocirc;m
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
and the girl stood erect in the flooding light and scanned
the strange landscape. Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s sagacious eyes noted
the fertility of the level lands at a distance from the
fire, and of the clefts, ledges and lower slopes of the
tumbled volcanic hills. Here and there he made out
the openings of caves, half overgrown with vines and
bush. And he was satisfied that this was the land for
his tribe to occupy.</p>
<p>That it was infested with all those monstrous beasts
which were Man&#8217;s deadliest foes seemed to him no
longer a fact worth considering. The bright god
which he had conquered should be made to conquer
them. Some inkling of his purposes he confided to the
girl, who stood looking up at him with eyes of dog-like
devotion from under the matted splendor of her hair.
If he was still the man she loved, her mate and lover,
yet was he also now a sort of demi-god, since she
had seen him play at his ease with the flames, and
drive the hyena, the saber-tooth and the terrible red
bear before him.</p>
<p>When the two started on their journey back to the
Country of the Little Hills, Gr&ocirc;m carried with him a
bundle of blazing brands. He had conceived the idea
of keeping the bright god alive by feeding him continually
as they went, and of renewing his might from
time to time by stopping to build a big fire.</p>
<p>The undertaking proved a troublesome one from the
first. The brand kept the great beasts at a distance,
time and again the red coals almost died out, and
Gr&ocirc;m had anxious and laborious moments nursing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
them again into activity; and the care of the mysterious
things made progress slow. Gr&ocirc;m learned much,
and rapidly, in these anxious efforts. He discovered
once, just at a critical moment, the remarkable efficacy
of dry grass. A bear as big as an ox came rushing
upon them, just when the flames were flickering out
along the bundle of brands. A-ya started to run,
but Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s nerve was of steel.</p>
<p>Ordering her to stop, he flung the brands to the
ground, and snatched a double handful of grass to
feed the dying flame. Luckily, the grass was dry.
It flared up on the sudden. The bear stopped short.
Gr&ocirc;m piled on more grass, shouted arrogantly, and
rushed at the beast with a blazing handful. It was a
light and harmless flame, almost instantly extinguished.
But it was too mysterious for the monster to face.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m was wise enough not to follow up his victory.
Returning to the fire he fed it to a safe volume. And
the girl, flinging herself down in a passion of relief
and adoration, embraced his knees.</p>
<p>After this they journeyed slowly, Gr&ocirc;m tending
the brands with vigilant care, and striving to break
down the girl&#8217;s terror of them. That night he built
three fires about the base of a huge tree, gathered a
supply of dry wood, taught the girl to feed the flames&ndash;&ndash;which
she did with head bowed in awe&ndash;&ndash;and passed
the hours of darkness, once so dreaded, in proud defiance
of the great beasts which prowled and roared
beyond the circle of light. He made the girl sleep,
but he himself was too prudent to sleep, lest these fires
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
of his own creation should prove false when his eye
was not upon them.</p>
<p>The following day, about midday, when he slept
heavily in the heat, the fire went out. It had got low,
and the girl, attempting to revive it, had smothered it
with too much fuel. In an agony of fear and remorse,
she knelt at Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s side, awakened him, and showed
him what she had done. She expected a merciless
beating, according to the rough-and-ready customs of
her tribe. But Gr&ocirc;m had always been held a little
peculiar, especially in his aversion to the beating of
women, so that certain females of the tribe had even
been known to question his manhood on that account.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he regarded the girl with a tenderness,
an admiration, an appreciation, which he could not
but wonder at in himself, seeing that he had never
heard of it as a customary thing that a man should
regard a woman in any such manner. At the same
time he was in a state of exaltation over his strange
achievements, and hardly open, at the moment, to any
common or base brutality of rage.</p>
<p>He gave the girl one terrible look, then went and
strove silently with the dead, black embers. The girl
crept up to him on her knees, weeping. For a few
seconds he paid her no heed. But when he found that
the flames had fled beyond recovery, he lifted her up,
drew her close to him, and comforted her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have let the Bright One escape,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;But do not be afraid. He lives back there in the
valley of the bears, and I will capture him again.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></p>
<p>And when the girl realized that he had no thought
of beating her, but only wished to comfort and shield
her, then she felt quite sure he was a god, and her
heart nearly burst with the passion of her love.</p>
<p style='text-align:center;margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1em;'>II</p>
<p>It galled Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s proud heart to find himself now
compelled, through loss of the fire, to go warily, to
scan the thicket, to keep hidden, to hold spear and
club always in readiness, and to climb into a tree at
night for safety like the apes. But he let no sign of
his chagrin, or of his anxiety, appear. Like the crafty
hunter and wise leader that he was, he forgot no one of
his ancient precautions.</p>
<p>They had by this time passed beyond the special
haunts of the red bear and the saber-tooth. Twice
they had to run before the charge of the great wooly
rhinoceros, against whose massive hide Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s spear
and club would have been about as effective as a
feather duster. But they had fled mockingly, for the
clumsy monster was no match for them in speed.
Once, too, they had been treed by a bull urus, a
gigantic white beast with a seven-foot spread of polished
horns.</p>
<p>But his implacable and patient rage they had cunningly
evaded by making off unseen and unheard,
through the upper branches. They came to earth
again half a mile away, and ran on gaily, laughing at
the picture of the furious and foolish beast waiting
there at the foot of the tree for them to come down.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
Once a prowling leopard confronted them for a
moment, only to flee in great leaps before their instant
and unhesitating attack. Once a huge bird, nearly
nine feet high, and with a beak over a foot in length,
struck at them savagely, with a shrill hissing, through
a fringe of reeds, because they had incautiously come
too near its nest. But they killed it, and feasted on
its eggs. And so, without further misadventure, they
came at last to the skirts of their own country, and
looked once more on the rounded, familiar, wind-swept
tops of the Little Hills, sacred to the barrows
of their dead.</p>
<p>It was toward sunset, and the long, rosy glow was
flooding the little amphitheater wherein the remnants
of the tribe were gathered, when Gr&ocirc;m crossed the
brook, and came striding up the slope, with A-ya close
behind him. She had been traveling at his side all
through the journey, but here she respected the etiquette
of her tribe, and fell behind submissively.</p>
<p>Hardly noticing, or not heeding if he noticed that
the tribe offered no vociferous welcome, and seemed
sullenly surprised at his appearance, Gr&ocirc;m strode
straight to the Chief, whom he saw sitting on the
judgment stone, and threw down spear and club at
his feet in sign of fealty. But A-ya, following, was
keen to note the hostile attitude of the tribe. Her
defiant eyes darted everywhere, and everywhere noted
black looks. She could not understand it, but she
divined that there was some plot afoot against Gr&ocirc;m.
Her heart swelled with rage, and her dark-maned head
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
went up arrogantly, for she felt as if the strongest and
wisest of the tribe were now but children in comparison
with her lord. But, though children, they were many,
and she closed up behind him for a guard, grasping
more firmly the shaft of her short, serviceable spear.
She saw the broad, black, scowling visage of young
Mawg, towering over a little group of his kinsfolk,
and eyeing her with mingled greed and rage, and she
divined at once that he was at the back of whatever
mischief might be brewing. She answered his look
with one of mocking scorn, and then turned her attention
to the Chief, who was sitting in grim silence,
the customary hand of welcome ominously withheld.</p>
<p>A haughty look came over Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s face, his broad
shoulders squared themselves, and he met the Chief&#8217;s
eyes sternly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have done the bidding of Bawr the Chief,&#8221; he
said, in a clear voice, so that all the tribe might hear.
&#8220;I have found a place where the tribe may hold themselves
secure against all enemies. And I have come
back, as was agreed, to lead the tribe thither before
our enemies destroy us. I have done great deeds.
I have not spared myself. I have come quickly. I
have deserved well of the people. Why has Bawr the
Chief no welcome for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>A murmur arose from the corner where Mawg and
his friends were grouped, but a glance from the Chief
silenced it. With his piercing gaze making relentless
inquisition of the eyes that answered his so steadily,
he seemed to ponder Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s words. Slowly the anger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
faded from his scarred and massy face, for he knew
men; and this man, though his most formidable rival
in strength and prestige, he instinctively trusted.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have been accused,&#8221; said he at length, slowly,
&#8220;of deserting the tribe in our weakness&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>A puzzled look had come over Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s face at the
word &#8220;accused&#8221;; then his deep eyes blazed, and he
broke in upon the Chief&#8217;s speech without ceremony.</p>
<p>&#8220;Show me my accusers!&#8221; he demanded harshly.
The Chief waved his hand for silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;In our weakness!&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;But you have
returned to us. So I see that charge was false. Also,
you have been accused of stealing the girl A-ya. But
you have brought her back. I see not what more your
accusers have against you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m turned, and, with a quick, decisive motion,
drew A-ya to his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bawr the Chief knows that I am his servant, and
a true man!&#8221; said he sternly. &#8220;I did not steal the
girl. She followed me, and I had no thought of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Angry jeers came from Mawg&#8217;s corner, but Gr&ocirc;m
smiled coldly, and went on:</p>
<p>&#8220;Not till near evening of the second day, when she
was chased by wolves, did she reveal herself to me.
And when I understood why she had come, I looked
on her, and I saw that she was very fair and very brave.
And I took her. So that now she is my woman, and
I hold to her, Chief! But I will pay you for her
whatsoever is just, for you are the Chief. And
now let Bawr show me my accusers, that I may have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
done with them quickly. For I have much to tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so, Gr&ocirc;m,&#8221; said the Chief, stretching out his
hand. &#8220;I am satisfied that you are a true man.
And for the girl, that will we arrange between us later.
But I will not confront you with your accusers, for
there shall be no fighting between ourselves when our
warriors that are left us are so few. And in this
I know that you, being wise, will agree with me.
Come, and we two will talk of what is to be done.&#8221;</p>
<p>He got up from his seat, an immense and masterful
figure, to lead the way to his own cave, where
they might talk in private. But Gr&ocirc;m hesitated, fearing
lest annoyance should befall A-ya if he left her
alone with his enemies.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the girl, Chief?&#8221; said he. &#8220;I would not have
her troubled.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bawr turned. He swept a comprehensive and significant
glance over the gaping crowd.</p>
<p>&#8220;The girl A-ya,&#8221; said he in his great voice which
thundered over the amphitheater, &#8220;is Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s woman.
I have spoken.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he strode off toward his cave door. Gr&ocirc;m
picked up his club and spear. And the girl, with a
haughty indifference she was far from feeling, strolled
off toward the cave of certain old women, kinsfolk
of the Chief.</p>
<p>But as the meaning of the Chief&#8217;s words penetrated
Mawg&#8217;s dull wits he gave vent to a great bellow of
rage, and snatched up a spear to hurl at Gr&ocirc;m. Before
he could launch it, however, his kinsmen, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
had no wish to bring down upon themselves both
Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s wrath and that of the Chief, fell upon him
and bore down his arm. Raging blindly, Mawg struggled
with them, and, having the strength of a bull, he
was near to wrenching himself free. But other men
of the tribe, seeing from the Chief&#8217;s action that their
bitterness against Gr&ocirc;m had been unjustified, and remembering
his past services, ran up and took a hand
in reducing Mawg to submission. For a few seconds
Gr&ocirc;m looked on contemptuously; then he turned on
his heel and followed the Chief, as if he did not hold
his rival worth a further thought. Mawg struggled
to his feet. Gr&ocirc;m had disappeared. But his eyes fell
on the figure of A-ya, slim and brown and tall, standing
in the entrance of the near-by cave. He made as
if to rush upon her, but a bunch of men stood in the
way, plainly ready to stop him. He looked at his
kinsmen, but they hung their heads sullenly. Blind
with fury though he was, and slow of wit, he could
not but see that the tribe as a whole was now against
him. Stuttering with his rage, he shouted to the girl,
&#8220;You will see me again!&#8221; Snatching up his club
and spears, he rushed forth from the amphitheater,
darted down the slope, and plunged into the thick woods
beyond the brook. His kinsmen withdrew sullenly into
their cave, followed by two young women. And the
rest of the people looked at each other doubtfully,
troubled at this sudden schism in the weakened tribe.</p>
<p>&#8220;One more good warrior gone!&#8221; muttered an old
man through his bush of matted white beard.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>That night Gr&ocirc;m was too wary to sleep, suspecting
that his enemy might return and try to snatch the
girl from him under the cover of the dark.</p>
<p>He was not attacked or disturbed, however, but
just before dawn, against the gray pallor beyond the
mouth of the pass, he marked four shapes slinking
forth. As they did not return, he did not think it
worth while to raise the alarm. When day came, it
was found that two kinsmen of Mawg, with the two
young women who were attached to them, had fled to
join the deserter in the bush. The Chief, indignant at
this further weakening of the tribe, declared them outlaws,
and ordered that all&ndash;&ndash;except the women, who
were needed as mothers&ndash;&ndash;should be killed as tribal
traitors, at sight.</p>
<p style='text-align:center;margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1em;'>III</p>
<p>As was natural since he was trying to present a
totally new conception, with no known analogies
save in the lightning and the sun, Gr&ocirc;m found it impossible
to convey to the Chief&#8217;s mind any real idea of
the nature of his tremendous discovery. He did succeed,
however, in making it clear to Bawr that there was
a certain mighty Bright One, capable of putting even
the saber-tooth and the red bear to instant flight, and
that he had somehow managed to subdue this powerful
and mysterious being into the service of the tribe.
Bawr had examined with deep musing the strange
black bite of the Bright One on Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s club and spear.
And he realized readily enough that with such an ally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
the tribe, even in its present state of weakness, would
be able to defy any further invasions of the bow-legged
beast-men from the east. There was a rumor, vague
enough but disquieting, of another migration of the
beast-men under way. So there was no time to lose.
Bawr gave orders that the tribe should get together
their scanty possessions of food, skins and weapons,
and make a start on the morrow for their new home.</p>
<p>The attempts of the girl, meanwhile, to explain
about the fire and Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s miraculous subjugation of
it to his will, had only spread terror in the tribe.
The dread of this unknown Bright One, which was
plainly capable of devouring them all if Gr&ocirc;m should
lose control of it, was more nerve-shaking than their
dread of the beast-men. Moreover, there was the
natural reluctance to leave the old, familiar dwellings
for an unknown, distrusted land, confessedly the haunt
of those monstrous beasts which they had most cause
to fear. Then, too, there were not a few in the tribe
who professed to think that the hordes of the Bow-legs
were never likely to come that way again. No wonder,
therefore, that there was grumbling, and protest, and
shrill lamentation in the caves; but Bawr being in no
mood, since the defection of Mawg and his party, to
tolerate any opposition, and Gr&ocirc;m being now regarded
as a dangerous wizard, the preparation for departure
went on as smoothly as if all were of one mind. Packing
was no great matter to the People of the Little
Hills, the richest of whom could transport all his
wealth on the back of the feeblest of his wives. So
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
it came that before the sun marked noon the whole
tribe was on the march, trailing forth from the neck of
the amphitheater at the heels of Gr&ocirc;m and A-ya, and
picking their way over the bones of their slain enemies
which the vultures and the jackals had already polished
white. Bawr, the Chief, came last, seeing to it that
there were no laggards; and as the tail of the straggling
procession left the pass he climbed swiftly to the
nearest pinnacle of rock to take observation. He
marked Gr&ocirc;m and the girl, the tribe strung out dejectedly
behind them, winding off to the left along
the foot of the bare hills; and a pang of grief, for an
instant, twitched his massive features. Then he turned
his eyes to the right. Very far off, in a space of open
ground by the brookside, he marked the movement of
confused, living masses, of a dull brown on the green.
A closer look convinced him that the moving masses
were men&ndash;&ndash;new hordes of the beast-men, the gaping-nosed
Bow-legs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gr&ocirc;m is a true man,&#8221; he muttered, with satisfaction,
and went leaping like a stag down the slope to
rejoin the tribe. When news of what he had seen was
passed from mouth to mouth through the tribe every
murmur was hushed, and the sulkiest laggards pushed
on feverishly, as if dreading a rush of the beast-men
from every cleft and glade.</p>
<p>The journey proved, for the most part, uneventful.
Traveling in a compact mass, only by broad day,
their numbers and their air of confidence kept the red
bear and the saber-tooth, the black lion and the wolf-pack,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
from venturing to molest them. By the Chief&#8217;s
orders they maintained a noisy chatter, with laughter
and shouting, as soon as they felt themselves safely
beyond range of the beast-men&#8217;s ears. For Bawr had
observed that even the saber-tooth had a certain uneasiness
at the sound of many human voices together. At
night&ndash;&ndash;and it was their rule to make camp while the
sun was yet several hours high&ndash;&ndash;with the aid of their
flint spear-heads they would laboriously cut down the
saplings of the long-thorned acacia, and surround the
camp with a barrier which the monsters dared not
assail. Even so, however, the nights were trying
enough to the stoutest nerves. Half the tribe at a
time was obliged to stand on guard, and there was
little sleep to refresh the weariest when the shadows
beyond the barriers were alive with mutterings and
prowlings, and terrible, paling, gleaming eyes.</p>
<p>On the fourth day of the journey, however, the
tribe met a foe whose dense brain was quite unimpressed
by the menace of the human voice, and whose
rage took no account of their numbers or their confidence.
An enormous bull urus&ndash;&ndash;perhaps the same
beast which some days earlier, had driven Gr&ocirc;m
and the girl into the tree-tops&ndash;&ndash;burst up, dripping and
mud-streaked from his wallow in a reedy pool, and
came charging upon the travelers with a roar. No
doubt an outcast from the herd, he was mad with the
lust of killing. With shouts of warning and shrieks
of fear the tribe scattered in every direction. The
nearest warriors hurled their spears as they sprang
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
aside, and several of the weapons went deep into the
monster&#8217;s flanks, but without checking him. He had
fixed his eyes on one victim, an old man with a conspicuous
shock of snow-white hair, and him he followed
inexorably. The doomed wretch screamed with
despair when he found himself thus hideously selected,
and ran, doubling like a rabbit. Just as the monster
overtook him he fell, paralyzed with his fright, and one
tremendous horn pinned him to the earth. At this
instant the Chief arrived, running up from the rear
of the line, and Gr&ocirc;m, coming from the front. The
Chief, closing in fearlessly, swung his club with all
his strength across the beast&#8217;s front, blinding one eye,
and confusing him for the fraction of a moment. And
in that moment, Gr&ocirc;m, calculating his blow with precision,
drove his spear clean through the massive throat.
As he sprang back, twisting his ragged weapon in the
wound and tearing it free, the monster, with a hoarse
cough, staggered forward across his victim, fell upon
his knees, and slowly sank, while the blood emptied itself
in enormous, smoking jets from the wound.</p>
<p>The incident caused a day&#8217;s delay in the march; for
there was the dead elder to be buried, with heavy stones
heaped over his body, according to the custom of the
tribe, and there was also the meat of the slain bull to
be cut up for carrying&ndash;&ndash;a rank food, but sustaining,
and not to be despised when one is on a journey with
uncertainties ahead. And the delay was more than
compensated for by the new spirit which now seized
this poor, fugitive remnant of the Tribe of the Little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
Hills. The speedy and spectacular triumph over a
foe so formidable as the giant bull urus was unanimously
accepted as an omen of good fortune.</p>
<p>As they approached the valley whose mouth was
guarded by the line of volcanic fire, Gr&ocirc;m purposely
led the tribe by such a path that they should get no
glimpse of the dancing flames until close upon them.
Down behind a long line of woods he led them, with
no warning of what was to come. Then suddenly
around into the open; and there, not a hundred paces
distant, was the valley-mouth, and the long, thin line
of flickering scarlet tongues drawn across it.</p>
<p>As the people came in sight of the incomprehensible
phenomenon, they stared for a moment, gasping,
or uttering low cries; then they fell upon their faces
in awe. Gr&ocirc;m remained standing, leaning upon his
spear; and A-ya stood with bowed head close behind
him. When the Chief, shepherding and guarding the
rear flanks, emerged around the elbow of woods and
saw his people thus prostrate before the shining wonder,
he too was moved to follow their example, for his
heart went cold within him. But not without reason
was he Chief, for he could control himself as well
as others. A pallor spread beneath the smoky tan
of his broad features, but without an instant&#8217;s hesitation
he strode to the front, and stood like Gr&ocirc;m, with
unbowed head, leaning calmly on his great club. His
thought was that the Shining One must be indeed a
god, and might, indeed, slay him from afar, like the
lightning, but it could not make him afraid.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m gave him a quick look of approval. &#8220;Tell
the people,&#8221; said he, &#8220;to follow us round through the
open space yonder, and into the valley, that we may
make camp, for there are many great beasts here, and
very fierce. And tell them not to approach the Shining
One, lest he smite them, but also not to fear, for
he will not come at them.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the people&ndash;&ndash;trembling, staring with fascinated
eyes at the dancing array, and shrinking nervously
from the strange warmth&ndash;&ndash;had all been gathered
into the open space between the fire and the thickets,
Gr&ocirc;m led the Chief up to the flames and hurriedly explained
to him what he had found out as to how they
must be managed. Then, leaving him to ponder the
miracle, and to experiment, he took A-ya to help him
build other fires along the edge of the thickets in order
to keep the monsters at bay. And all the while the
tribe sat watching, huddled on their haunches, with
mouths agape and eyes rolling in amazement.</p>
<p>Bawr the Chief, meanwhile, was revolving many
things in his sagacious brain, as he alternately lighted
and extinguished the little, eating flames which fixed
themselves upon the dry wood when he held it in the
blaze. His mind was of a very different order from
that of Gr&ocirc;m, though, perhaps, not less capacious
and capable. Gr&ocirc;m was the discoverer, the initiator,
while Bawr was essentially the ruler, concerned to
apply all he learned to the extension and securing of
his power. It was his realization of Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s transparent
honesty and indifference to power which made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
him so free from jealousy of Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s prestige. His
shrewd perceptions told him that Gr&ocirc;m would far
rather see him rule the tribe, so long as he ruled it
effectually, than be troubled with the task himself.
But there were others in the tribe whom he suspected of
being less disinterested&ndash;&ndash;who were capable of becoming
troublesome if ever he should find his strength failing.
One of these, in particular, a gigantic, black-browed
fellow by the name of Ne-boo, remotely akin
to the deserter Mawg, was now watching him with
eyes more keen and considerate than those of his companions.
As Bawr became conscious of this inquiring,
crafty gaze, he made a slip, and closed his left hand
on a portion of his branch which was still glowing red.
With superb nerve he gave no sign of the hurt. And
he thought quickly: he had taken a liberty with the
Bright One, and been bitten by those mysterious, shining
teeth which left a scar of black. Well, someone
else should be bitten, also. Calmly heating the branch
again till it was a live coal for three-quarters of its
length, he called the crafty-eyed warrior to him. The
man came, uneasy, but full of interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take this, and hold it for me,&#8221; said Bawr, and
tossed him the red brand. With shrinking hands
Ne-boo caught it, to drop it instantly with a yell of
pain and terror. It fell, scraping his leg, and his
foot, and in his fright he threw himself down beside
it, begging it not to smite him again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Strange,&#8221; said Bawr, in a voice for all the tribe
to hear, &#8220;the Shining One will not suffer Ne-boo to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
touch him.&#8221; With the air of a high priest he picked
the brand up, and held it again into the flames. And
Gr&ocirc;m returning at this moment to his side, he commanded
in a low voice: &#8220;Let none but ourselves attend
or touch the Bright One.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m, his mind occupied with plans for the settling
of the tribe, agreed without asking the reason for this
decree. He was thinking about getting the tribe
housed in the caves which he had noticed in the steep
sides of the valley. He knew well enough that these
caves were the houses of the red bear, the saber-tooth
and the bone-crushing hyenas, but, as he explained to
the Chief with thrilling elation, the Shining One would
drive these monsters out, and teach them to keep their
distance. To Bawr, who had had some experience
in his day with the red bear and the saber-tooth, and
who had not yet seen all that these dancing tongues of
gold and scarlet could do, the enterprise seemed a
formidable one. But he sagaciously reserved his judgment,
pondering things that he felt sure Gr&ocirc;m would
not dream of.</p>
<p>That night, when all was thick darkness beyond the
magic circle of the fires, the People of the Little Hills
sat or crouched trembling and wondering, while
monstrous dim shapes of such bears or tigers as they
had never imagined in their worst nightmares prowled
roaring all about them, held off by nothing more substantial
than just those thin and darting tongues of
flame. That the little, bright things could bite terribly
they had evidence enough, both in the charred and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
corroded wood which the flames had licked, and in the
angry wounds of Ne-boo. At the same time they saw
their Chief and Gr&ocirc;m apparently handling the Terror
with impunity, and the girl A-ya approaching it and
serving it freely, though always with bowed head and
every mark of awe.</p>
<p>But what made the deepest, the most ineffaceable
impression on the minds of the tribe was to see Gr&ocirc;m
and the Chief, each waving a pair of dead branches all
aflame, charge at a pair of giant saber-tooths who had
ventured too near, and drive them scurrying like
frightened sheep into the bush. Repeating the tactics
which he had previously found so effective, Gr&ocirc;m
hurled one of his flaming weapons after the fugitives&ndash;&ndash;an
example which the Chief, not to be outshone,
followed instantly. The result was startling. The
brands chanced to fall where there was a great accumulation
of dry wood and twigs and leaves. In a
moment, as it seemed, the flames had leapt up into
full fury, and were chasing the fugitives up the valley
with a roar. In the sudden great glare could be seen
saber-tooths stretching out in panic-stricken flight,
burly red bear fleeing with their awkward but deadly
swift gallop, huge hyenas scattering to this side and
that, and many furtive unknown creatures driven into
a blind and howling rout. Gr&ocirc;m himself was as
thunderstruck as any one at the amazing result of
his action, but his quick wits told him to disguise his
astonishment, and bear himself as if it were exactly
what he had planned. The Chief copied his attitude
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
with scrupulous precision and unfailing nerve, though
quite prepared to see the red whirlwind suddenly turn
back and blot himself, the audacious Gr&ocirc;m, and the
whole shuddering tribe from the face of the outraged
earth. But no such thing happened. The torrent of
flame raged straight up the valley, cutting a path some
fifty odd paces in width, and leaving a track of smoldering,
winking, red stems and stumps behind it. And
all the beasts hid themselves in their terror so that not
one of them was seen again that night. As for the
People of the Little Hills, they were now ready to
fall down and put dust in their hair in utter abasement,
if either Gr&ocirc;m or the Chief so much as looked
at them.</p>
<p>Soon after sunrise the next day, the Chief and
Gr&ocirc;m, bearing lighted brands, and followed close by
A-ya with a bundle of dry faggots, twigs and grass,
took possession of two great caves on the southward-facing
slope of the valley. The giant bears which
occupied one of them fled ignominiously at the first
threat of the flames, having been scorched and
thoroughly cowed by the conflagration of the previous
night. The other cave had been already vacated by
the hyena pack, which had no stomach to face these
throwers of flame. Before the mouth of each cave,
at a safe distance, a fire was lighted&ndash;&ndash;a notice to all
the beasts that their rule was at an end. The whole
tribe was set to the gathering of a great store of fuel,
which was heaped about the mouths of the caves as a
shield against the weather. Then the people began to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
settle themselves in their new home, secure in the faith
that not even the hordes of the Bow-legs, should they
chance that way, would have the temerity to face their
new and terrible protector.</p>
<p>When all was ordered to his satisfaction, the Chief
called Gr&ocirc;m to his side. The two stood apart, and
watched the tall figure of A-ya moving from the one
fire to the other, and tending them reverently, as one
performing a rite. Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s eyes took on a certain
illumination at the sight of her, a look which the Chief
had never observed in any man&#8217;s eyes before. But
he thought little of it, for his mind was full of other
matters.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is well,&#8221; said he presently, in a low voice, &#8220;that
the service and understanding of the Bright One should
not be allowed to the people, but should be kept strictly
to ourselves, and to those whom we shall choose to
initiate. I shall appoint the two best men of my own
kin, and two others whom you shall select, as servants
of the Bright One. And I will make a law that the
people shall henceforth worship only the Bright One,
instead of, as heretofore, the Thunder, and the Wind,
and the unknown Spirits, which, after all, as far as I
can see, have never been able to do much either for or
against us. But this Bright One is a real god, such
as we can be sure of. And you and I shall be his
priests. And only we shall be allowed to understand
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is good,&#8221; agreed Gr&ocirc;m, whose brain was
busy devising other ways of making the wild flames
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
serviceable to man. &#8220;But,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;there is A-ya.
She knows as much about it as you and I.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Chief pondered a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Either the girl must die,&#8221; said he, eyeing Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s
face, &#8220;or she must be a priest along with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think she will be a very good priest,&#8221; said Gr&ocirc;m
drily, his eyes resting upon her.</p>
<p>Then the Chief, ascending a rock between the two
fires, spoke to the people, and decreed as he had
said. He told a little about the Shining One, just so
much as he thought it good for his hearers to know.
He declared that the ones he had chosen for the great
honor of serving the fires must tend them by turns,
night and day, and guard them with their lives; for
that, if one or the other should be suffered to die out,
some great disaster would assuredly come upon the
tribe.</p>
<p>&#8220;And henceforth,&#8221; he concluded, &#8220;you shall not be
called the People of the Little Hills; for these ridges,
indeed, are not such hills as those whose bald and windy
tops are keeping the bones of our fathers. But you
shall be known and feared greatly by our enemies as
&#8216;The Children of the Shining One,&#8217; under whose protection
I declare you.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>THE PULLER-DOWN OF TREES</h3>
</div>
<p>On the broken hill-slope overlooking the Valley
of Fire, in the two great caves known as the
Cave of the Bears and the Cave of the Hyenas, the
tribe of the Children of the Shining One now dwelt
secure and began to recover heart. Before each cave-mouth,
tended night and day, burned the sacred flame,
its tongues licked upwards in gold and scarlet with a
radiance from which all the tribe, with the sole exceptions
of Bawr, the Chief, and Gr&ocirc;m, his right hand
and councilor, were wont to avert their eyes in awe
whenever they passed it in their comings and goings.
Only from a distance would they presume to look at
the flames directly; and ever as they looked their
wonder and their reverence grew. Their trust in the
protection of the Shining One came to have no bounds,
for night after night would the great red bears return,
prowling in the mysterious gloom just beyond the ring
of light, with their dreadful eyes turned fixedly upon
their former habitation, only to be driven off ignominiously
when Gr&ocirc;m rushed at them with a shout and a
flaming torch above his head. And night after night
would the troops of the hyenas come back, their
monstrous-jowled heads swinging low from their
mighty shoulders, to sit and howl their devilish laughter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
above their ancient lair, only to slink off in cowed
silence when the Chief would hurl a blazing brand
among them. When the beasts were thus discomfited
and abashed, the boldest of the warriors would go
leaping after them and bring down the hindermost
with spears. So it came about that presently the
great animals knew themselves beaten, and sullenly
withdrew to the other side of the hills.</p>
<p>It was just this country at the other side of the
hills which most appealed to the restless imagination
of Gr&ocirc;m. Within the valley&ndash;&ndash;which widened out,
as it receded from its fiery gateway, to enclose league
upon league of fertile plain&ndash;&ndash;was good hunting, along
with an abundance of roots, fruits and edible herbs.
But in Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s heart burned that spirit of unquenchable
expectation which has led the race of Man upwards
through all obstacles&ndash;&ndash;the urge to find out ever what
lies beyond. So the saw-toothed line of these dark,
volcanic summits drew him irresistibly, with the
promise of unknown wonders hidden behind them.</p>
<p>During these few weeks since coming to the Valley
of the Fire, Gr&ocirc;m had been tirelessly experimenting
with the bright element, trying this kind of fuel and
that, one after another, in order to learn what food
was most acceptable to it. He learned that certain
substances it would devour in raging haste, only to fail
and die soon after; or not truly to die, he imagined,
but to flee back unseen to its dancing, flickering source
at the valley mouth. Other substances he found that
it would consume slowly, but pertinaciously. While
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
into yet others, such as dry turf and punk, it would
eat its way and hide, maintaining therein for a long
time a retired but potent existence, ready to leap into
radiant life under certain provocation. His invention
stimulated by these experiments, he had made himself
several hollow tubes of a thick green bark whipped
about with thongs, and had stuffed them with that
mixture of turf and punk which he found best calculated
to hold the furtive seeds of fire alive.</p>
<p>With one of these slow torches alight, and several
spare ones slung over his shoulders, Gr&ocirc;m set out to
cross the pointed hills and seek new wonders in the
lands beyond. The tall girl, A-ya, went with him.
This not being customary in the tribe, they gave reasons.
Gr&ocirc;m said that he needed the girl because she
alone knew how rightly to serve and tend the Shining
One in combat. It was a good reason, but he was
amazed to find in his heart so deep a desire for her that
he was ill-content whenever his eyes could not rest upon
her. There was no one in the tribe with whom he could
discuss this strange emotion, for no one, not even the
wise and subtle-minded Chief, would have comprehended
it&ndash;&ndash;romantic love not yet having come openly
to these men of the Morning of Time. So Gr&ocirc;m gave
the lesser reason, which all, including himself, could
understand. As for the girl, she said that whatever
her lord commanded she must needs obey, which she
did with a most seemly readiness. But in her heart
she knew that if her man had commanded her to stay
behind, she would have obeyed only so long as he remained
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
in sight, and would then have followed him.</p>
<p>Like Gr&ocirc;m, the girl carried two flint-headed spears.
Both wore clumsy but effective slivers of flint, for
knives, in their girdles of twisted skin. The girl, besides
her weapons, carried a substantial burden of
strips of meat dried hard in the sun, in case game
should prove scarce or elusive in the land beyond the
hills. But when they had got well out of sight of the
caves, Gr&ocirc;m turned, relieved her of her burdens which,
according to tribal conventions, it was her duty to
carry for her man, and gave her instead the light but
precious tube of fire.</p>
<p>As they ascended the ragged slopes, vegetation grew
sparse, and when toward nightfall they gained the pass
which Gr&ocirc;m was making for&ndash;&ndash;a deep cleft between two
steep red and purple peaks&ndash;&ndash;the rock beneath their
feet was naked but for a low growth of flowering
herbs and thorn. The pass was too high for the aloe
and mesembryanthemum to flourish, and the lava-bed
which floored it was yet too new to have clothed itself
in any of the larger mountain-loving trees. Here they
passed the night, in a shallow niche of rock with a
fire before it; and the fire being visible from a long
way off, no prowlers cared even to approach it.</p>
<p>On the following day they traveled swiftly, but
the pass was long. It was near sunset again when
at last the rocks fell away to either side, and they
saw spread out below their feet the land which they
had come to explore.</p>
<p>It was a vast, rolling plain, golden-green with rank,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
cane-like grasses, dotted with innumerable clumps of
trees, and laced with full watercourses which lay in
spacious loops of blue and silver. Here and there lay
broad, irregular patches where the grass did not flourish,
and these were of vivid emerald-green from some
unknown growth.</p>
<p>Along the horizon to the north sparkled a great
water. And half-way down the steep, toward the
right, smoked and smouldered a shallow, saucer-shaped
crater from whose broken lower rim a purple-brown
serpent of comparatively recent lava descended in sluggish
curves across the intense green.</p>
<p>Somewhat to the girl&#8217;s apprehension, Gr&ocirc;m seemed
anxious to investigate the smoking crater, but the
only practicable path down the mountain led them
away from it, so he was content to leave it for another
time and another, perhaps less repellent, approach.</p>
<p>Descending presently into a region of ledges and
ravines clothed with dense thickets, they found on
every hand traces of the giant bears and the saber-tooth
tigers whom they had driven from the caves
in the Valley of Fire. Gr&ocirc;m hurriedly whirled the
smoldering torch into a flame, and from it lighted a
couple of resinous brands, one for himself, and one
for A-ya to carry. Thus armed, they fearlessly followed
the broad trail of bears, which led them very
conveniently down the steep. And bear and saber-tooth
alike, at sight of the flame thus apparently seeking
them out, remembered their recent scorching discomfiture,
and slunk off like whipped curs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s immediate object was to make his way
straight to the shores of that great water, whose gleaming
on the horizon had been like an invitation to his
inquiring spirit. But when early in the forenoon of
the fourth day they reached the lowlands, he found
that his way would be anything but straight. The
immense grasses, a species of cane, grew so tall, so
dense and so thick in the stem, that it was impossible
to force a path through them just where he would.</p>
<p>He saw that he must use the trails of the wild
beasts, which intersected it in all directions. There
were the tracks of every animal he knew&ndash;&ndash;the hunters
and the hunted alike&ndash;&ndash;and of many more which he
did not know. But one broad trail in particular arrested
his attention. It struck such fear to the heart
of the girl, whose eyes were keen and understanding,
that her knees trembled beneath her, and had she dared
she would have begged Gr&ocirc;m to turn back from a
land which held such monsters.</p>
<p>Even Gr&ocirc;m himself felt a thrill of awe as he stared
at the trail which bespoke so mighty a traveler.
Wherever it led, the sturdiest growths were crushed
flat as if some huge bowlder from the mountains had
been rolled over them. And the monster footprints,
which here and there stamped themselves clearly in
the trail, were thrice the size of those of the hugest
mammoth.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m stooped and studied these footprints, pondering
them with knit brows. What manner of giant it
might be which moved on such colossal and misshapen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
members it was beyond his wits to guess. But of a
surety it was a fine roadmaker!</p>
<p>With a confident arrogance born of the knowledge
that he was the lord of Fire, he deliberately chose to
pursue this dreadful trail. And the girl, hiding her
terror lest it should diminish her credit in his sight,
followed close at his elbow, her bright eyes tirelessly
searching the jungle on either side.</p>
<p>Suddenly behind them came a confused, terrifying
noise of panting breaths and trampling feet. It came
sweeping down the broad trail. There were grunting
cries, also; and Gr&ocirc;m understood at once that a herd
of pig-tapirs&ndash;&ndash;heavy-footed, timorous beasts, as tall
as heifers&ndash;&ndash;were sweeping down upon them in mad
flight before some unknown pursuer.</p>
<p>Against that blind panic, that headlong frantic rush,
he knew that blazing brands would avail nothing. He
clutched the girl by the hand. &#8220;Come!&#8221; he ordered.
And they fled side by side down the trail.</p>
<p>It was in their minds to climb the first suitable
tree they should come to, and let the rout go by.
In half a minute or so, over the tops of the giant
grasses, they sighted such a tree, only a few hundred
yards ahead. The trail, swerving opportunely, appeared
to lead directly towards its foot, and they raced
on, the girl now laughing softly with excitement, and
forgetting her fear of the unknown because of the
known peril behind her. It pleased her curiously to
find that her man had not grown too divine to be ready
to run away on fitting occasion; and she kept glancing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
at him from under her dark tangle of hair with
eyes of passionate possession.</p>
<p>The wild uproar behind was drawing nearer swiftly,
but the refuge was now not more than fifty paces
ahead. All at once the way to it was barred.
Out from a little side-track on the right came
lumbering a gigantic rhinoceros, his creased and folded
hide clothed in matted brown wool and caked with
clay. He swung round into the trail, almost blocking
it with his bulk, stared for a couple of seconds with
evil little eyes at the two slim beings before him, then
lowered the huge double horn that armed his snout,
and charged at them with a grunt of fury.</p>
<p>Caught thus fairly between the devil before, and
the deep sea of trampling hoofs behind, Gr&ocirc;m had no
choice. A second&#8217;s waving of the lighted brands convinced
him that the rhinoceros was too dense of brain
to fear the fire, or even to notice it. Once more
clutching the girl&#8217;s hand, he ran back a little way, seeking
to draw the two perils together, and give them an
opportunity to distract each other&#8217;s attention.</p>
<p>He ran back till the flying, plunging herd of the
pig-tapirs came into full view around the curve of
the trail. Then, with all his strength, he forced his
way into the grass, on the left, shouldering aside the
upright stems to make room for the girl to enter.
She hurled her blazing brand full into the face of the
rhinoceros, hoping to confuse or divert him for an
instant, then thrust herself lithely in past Gr&ocirc;m.</p>
<p>The rhinoceros was diverted for an instant. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
smoke and sparks half blinded him, and in a paroxysm
of fury he checked himself to trample the strange assailant
under foot. Then he thundered forward. But
the tough stems of the grass had closed up again. The
two fugitives were hidden. He saw the packed herd
of the tapirs bearing down upon him; and, forgetting
the insignificant creatures who had first roused his
anger, he charged forward at full speed to meet this
new foe.</p>
<p>Realizing well enough that in three or four seconds
more the crash would come, and that the struggle
between the rhinoceros and the maddened herd would
be little short of a cataclysm, Gr&ocirc;m and the girl struggled
breathlessly to force themselves to a safe distance
lest they should be crushed in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e.</p>
<p>The sweat ran down into their eyes, and swarms
of tiny insects, breeding in the giant stems, choked
their throats and nostrils; but they wrestled their way
onward blindly, foot by foot. Behind them, out in
the trail, came a ponderous crash, and, then an appalling
explosion of squeals, screams, grunts and roars. The
next instant the rigid stems gave way suddenly before
them, and they fell forward, with a startled cry from
the girl, into a deep and sunless water.</p>
<p>They came up, spluttering and choking; but as soon
as she could catch breath the girl laughed, whereupon
the grimness of Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s face relaxed. The water was
a deep creek, perfectly overshadowed and hidden by
the rank growth along its banks. But just opposite
was the tree whose refuge they had been trying to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
gain. They swam across in half-a-dozen strokes, and
drew themselves ashore, and shook themselves like a
pair of retrievers. Through all the flight, the fierce
effort among the grass-stems, and the unexpected ducking,
they had kept tenacious hold of every one of their
treasures. But&ndash;&ndash;their fire was out! The brand was
black; the precious tube, with the seeds of fire lurking
at its heart, was drenched, saturated and lifeless.</p>
<p>For a moment or two Gr&ocirc;m looked into the girl&#8217;s
eyes steadily, conveying to her without a word the
whole tremendous significance of their loss. The girl
responded, after a second&#8217;s dismay, with a look of trust
and adoration which brought a rush of warmth to
Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s heart. He smiled proudly, and shook his
club as if to reassure himself. Then, climbing hurriedly
into the tree, they stared back over the plumed
tops of the grasses.</p>
<p>The sight that met their eyes was not one for weak
nerves. The spot in the grass which they had just
escaped from was a shambles. The foremost of the
panic-stricken pig-tapirs, met by the charge of the
rhinoceros, had been ripped and split by the rooting
of his double horn, and hurled to either side as if
by some titanic plough. A couple more had been
trampled down and crushed before his charge was
stayed by the irresistible pressure of the surging, squealing
mass.</p>
<p>There he had stood fast, like a jagged promontory
in the surges, tossing his mighty head and thrusting
hideously, while the rest of the herd passed on, either
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
scrambling clean over him or breaking down the canes
and pouring around on either side. Of those that
passed over him about one in every three or four got
ripped by the tossing horn, and went staggering forward
a few paces, only to fall and be trodden out by
their fellows. Close behind the last of the squealing
fugitives came the cause of their panic&ndash;&ndash;two immense
black lions, who had apparently been playing with their
prey like cats.</p>
<p>When they came face to face with the rhinoceros
where he stood among his victims, shaking the blood
from horn and head and shoulder, they stopped abruptly.
Together, perhaps, they would have been a
match for him. But theirs was a far higher intelligence
than his. They knew the almost impenetrable
toughness of his hide, his Berserk rage, his imperviousness
to reasonable fear; and they had no care to engage
themselves without cause in so uncertain and unprofitable
a combat.</p>
<p>With a roar that rolled in thunder over the plain and
seemed to set the very tree-tops quivering, they leaped
lazily aside and went off in enormous bounds through
the grass, circling about as if to intercept, in sheer
wantonness of slaughter, the remnants of the fleeing
herd. At the sight Gr&ocirc;m frowned anxiously, thinking
how helpless he and the girl would be against such
foes, now that they no longer had the Shining One to
protect them.</p>
<p>Squealing to split the ears, the pig-tapirs came galloping
past the tree, making for a piece of water some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
furlongs further on, where doubtless they hoped to
evade both the lion and the rhinoceros. But they
had yet another adversary to reckon with.</p>
<p>Just past the tree, at a thicket of immense scarlet
poinsettias, the trail curved sharply. From behind the
poinsettias arose a gigantic shape unlike anything that
Gr&ocirc;m had ever dreamed of. And he knew that the
maker of the mysterious trail and those tremendous
footprints was before him.</p>
<p>With a trumpeting bray of indignation the monster
sat upright on hind-quarters far more ponderous than
those of a mammoth. Its tail, as thick at the base
as the body of a bear, helped to support it, while its
clumsy frame towered to a height of eighteen or twenty
feet. Its hind legs were very short, thick like tree-trunks,
grotesquely bowed; and its thighs like buttresses.
Its fore legs were more arms than legs, of
startling length and massive strength, draped in long,
stiff hair, and terminated by colossal hands with immense
hooked claws for fingers. The whole body was
clothed with rusty hair of an amazing coarseness,
like matting fiber. The vast head, flat on top and prolonged
to a snout that was almost a proboscis, had
the look of being deformed by reason of its fantastically
exaggerated jowl, or lower jaw. This terrifying
monster thrust out a narrow pink tongue, some three
or four feet in length, stooped and turned, and gave
a hurried look at something crouching behind its mighty
thighs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Its baby!&#8221; muttered the girl, with a little indrawn
breath of sympathy.</p>
<p>Then the strange being sat up again to meet and
ward off the rush of the maddened pig-tapirs.</p>
<p>For a moment it beat off the assault, seizing the
frantic beasts and hurling them this way and that as
if they had been so many rabbits. Then it was completely
surrounded by the reeking squealing bleeding
horde, which paid no more personal attention to it than
if it had been a mass of rock. They rolled over the
little one, unheeding, and trod it flat. Its death cry
split the air; and at that sound the mother seemed to
sink down into her haunches. In her agony of rage
and grief she literally tore some of her assailants in
halves, throwing the awful fragments impatiently from
her in order to lose no time in seizing a new victim.
A few seconds more and the rush was past; and
presently the mad rout was hurling itself with a
tremendous splashing into the water. The monster
looked around for more victims&ndash;&ndash;and was just in
time to see the hideous vision of the rhinoceros charging
down upon her. Triumphant from the encounter
with the lions, he rushed back to slake his still unsatisfied
fury on the pig-tapirs. At any other time he
would have given such an antagonist as the colossal
megatherium a wide berth; but just now he was in one
of his madnesses. His furious little swinish eyes
blinking through the blood which dripped over them, he
hurled himself straight onward. His horn was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
plunged into the monster&#8217;s paunch; but at the same
time one of those gigantic armed hands fell irresistibly
on his neck, shattering the vertebr&aelig; through
all their deep protection of hide and muscle. He collapsed
with an explosive grunt; and the giant hands
tossed him aside.</p>
<p>It was a frightful wound which the monster had
received, but for a few moments she paid no attention
to it, being occupied in licking the trampled body of
her young one with that amazing tongue of hers.
At length, apparently convinced that the little one was
quite dead, she brayed again piteously, dropping forward
upon all fours, and made off slowly down the
trail, walking with grotesque awkwardness on the sides
of her feet. For two or three hundred yards she kept
on, drawing a wake of crimson behind her; and then,
apparently exhausted by her wound, she turned off
among the canes, and lay down, close beside the trail,
but effectively screened from it.</p>
<p>From their place in the tree Gr&ocirc;m and the girl
had followed breathlessly these astounding encounters.
At last Gr&ocirc;m spoke:</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a country of very great beasts,&#8221; he remarked,
with the air of one announcing a discovery.
As A-ya showed no inclination whatever to dissent
from this statement, he presently went on to his conclusion,
leaving her to infer his minor premise.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must go back and recover the Shining One.
It is not well for us to go on without him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed the girl eagerly. For all her courage
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
and passionate trust in her man, the sight of those
black lions bounding over the tops of the towering
grasses had somewhat shaken her nerve. She feared
no beasts but the swiftest, and those which might
leap into the lower branches of the trees. &#8220;Yes!&#8221;
she repeated. &#8220;Let us go back for the Shining One,
lest he be angry at us for having put him in the water.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But for yet a day more we will stay here in this
tree, and rest and sleep in safety,&#8221; continued Gr&ocirc;m,
&#8220;that we may travel the more swiftly, till we get beyond
the grasses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, climbing higher into the tree, he proceeded to
build a platform and roof of interlaced branches for
their temporary home. In this task the girl did not
help him, because of the great muscular strength which
it required. She lay in a crotch, her hairy but long and
shapely legs coiled under her like a leopard&#8217;s, now
gazing at her man with ardent eyes, now staring out
apprehensively across the sun-drenched, perilous landscape.</p>
<p>Suddenly she gave a cry of amazement, and pointed
excitedly down the trail. Beyond the water wherein
the pig-tapirs had found refuge, beyond the lurking-place
of the wounded megatherium, came three men,
running desperately. Shading his eyes, Gr&ocirc;m made
out that they were nearly exhausted. They were
clearly men of the type of his own tribe, light-skinned
and well shaped; and the leader, who carried a long
club, was a man of stature equal to his own. Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s
sympathies went out to them, and his impulse was to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
hasten to their assistance. Glancing further along the
trail to learn the cause of their headlong flight, he saw
two black lions in pursuit, probably the same two which
had been driving the pig-tapirs a couple of hours earlier.
They were coming on at such a pace that Gr&ocirc;m feared
the weary fugitives would be overtaken before they
could reach the tree of refuge. Instinctively he started
to climb down. But, his eyes falling upon the girl,
he remembered that he had no right to enter upon a
venture so utterly hopeless while he had her to take
care of. His eager clutch upon his spear relaxed.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are spent. They&#8217;ll never get here!&#8221; he
muttered anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; said A-ya, with blank unconcern. &#8220;The lions
will get them. It&#8217;s Mawg, and his two cousins.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m growled an exclamation of astonishment.
The girl&#8217;s eyes&ndash;&ndash;or her intuitions&ndash;&ndash;were keener than
his. But he saw at a second glance that she was
right.</p>
<p>At this moment Mawg, running a few paces in advance
by reason of his superior speed and stamina,
passed the spot where the wounded megatherium lay
hidden. The monster lifted her dreadful head. The
next second the other two arrived, running elbow to
elbow, with drooped shoulders of exhaustion. Through
the screen of canes a gigantic hand shot out above
their heads and came down upon them, crushing the
two together. They had not time for outcry; but it
was clear that some sound caught the leader&#8217;s ears,
for he glanced back over his shoulder. He was near
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
enough now for the keen-eyed watchers in the tree
to see his face change with horror. He ran on without
a pause, but now with fresh speed, as if the sight
had shocked him into new vigor. Seeing that there
was, after all, a good prospect of his reaching the tree
in time, Gr&ocirc;m swung down to be ready to help him up.
As he did so he saw the two lions approach the hiding-place
of the monster.</p>
<p>The vast, clawed hand still lay there on the two
crushed bodies in the middle of the trail. The lions
saw it, and they checked themselves at a safe distance.
They knew that just behind the grass-screen lurked
another such shaggy and monstrous member, waiting
to rend them as they would rend an antelope. They
shrank, and drew back, snarling angrily. It is possible
they feared lest the screen on either side of the
trail might conceal more than one of the monsters;
for they sprang far aside as if to make a wide circuit
of the perilous spot.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s plenty of time!&#8221; muttered Gr&ocirc;m, and
dropped upon his feet in the middle of the trail. The
girl came in mad haste after him, but at his sharp
command &#8220;Stay there!&#8221; she contented herself with
slipping out upon the lowest branch, just over his head,
and holding her spear ready.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kill him!&#8221; she cried. But Gr&ocirc;m seemed not to
hear.</p>
<p>Staggering, and half blind with exhaustion Mawg
was within twenty paces before he noticed who was
confronting him. Then his dull eyes blazed. With a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
snarl of fury he hurled his club straight at Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s
face, missing him only by a hand&#8217;s-breadth. But the
effort, and the disappointment at finding himself thus
balked, as he imagined, on the very threshold of escape,
seemed to finish him. He stumbled on with
groping hands outstretched, and fell just at Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s
feet.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m hesitated, wondering how he could get this
inert weight up into the tree. The girl did not understand
his hesitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kill him!&#8221; she hissed, leaning down eagerly from
her branch overhead.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he&#8217;s a great warrior, and the tribe needs him,&#8221;
answered Gr&ocirc;m, stooping to shake the prostrate form.</p>
<p>Mawg stirred, beginning to recover. Gr&ocirc;m shook
him again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Up into the tree, quick!&#8221; he ordered in a loud,
sharp voice. &#8220;The lions are coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mawg roused himself, sat up, and stared with a
look of bewilderment changing swiftly into hate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Up!&#8221; shouted Gr&ocirc;m again. &#8220;The tree. They&#8217;re
coming!&#8221;</p>
<p>At this the fellow growled, but sprang up as if
he had been jabbed with a spear, and clambered into
the tree as nimbly as a monkey. Gr&ocirc;m followed,
quickly but coolly. A-ya, who had waited with her
eyes watchfully on Mawg, stepped close to Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s
side; and all three swung upwards into the higher
branches as the two lions arrived beneath.</p>
<p>Glaring up into the tree with shrewd, malevolent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
eyes, the great beasts realized that, for the present
at least, the tree man-creatures were quite out of
reach. Lashing their tufted tails in disappointment,
they turned aside to sniff, in surly scorn, at the dead,
mountainous hulk of the rhinoceros, which lay with
one ponderous foot stuck up in the air as if in clumsy
protest at Fate. Comprehending readily the manner
of its death, they came back and lay down under the
tree, and fell to gnawing lazily at the body of one of
the pig-tapirs which the megatherium had torn in two.
They had the air of intending to stay some time, so
Gr&ocirc;m presently turned his attention to his rescued
rival.</p>
<p>Mawg was sitting on the next branch, a good
spear&#8217;s length distant, and glowering at A-ya&#8217;s lithe
shapeliness with eyes of savage greed. Gr&ocirc;m knit his
brows, and significantly passed an arm about the girl&#8217;s
shoulders. Mawg shifted his attention to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want of me?&#8221; he demanded, in a
thick, guttural voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you ran as if you did not want the
lions to eat you,&#8221; answered Gr&ocirc;m.</p>
<p>Mawg stared with a stupid brutality and incomprehension;
and the eyes of the two men, meeting fairly,
seemed to lock in a duel of personalities.</p>
<p>They presented a significant contrast. Both, physically,
superb specimens of their race&ndash;&ndash;the highest then
evolved upon the youthful earth&ndash;&ndash;the elder man, in
his ample forehead and calm, reasoning eyes, displayed
all the promise of the future; while the youth,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
low skulled and with his dull but pugnacious eyes set
under enormous bony brows, suggested the mere brute
from which the race had mounted. His hair was
shorter and coarser than Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s, and foully matted;
and his neck was set very far forward between his
powerful but lumpy shoulders. The color of his coarse
and furrowed skin was so dark as to make the
weathered tan of Gr&ocirc;m and A-ya look white by
contrast.</p>
<p>In no way lacking courage, but failing in will and
steadiness, in a dozen seconds Mawg involuntarily
shifted his gaze, and looked down at the lions.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want of me?&#8221; he demanded again,
as if he had had no answer before.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tribe has too few warriors left. I will take
you back to the tribe!&#8221; replied Gr&ocirc;m with authority.</p>
<p>Mawg curled back his thick lips from his great
yellow dog-teeth in a snarling laugh of incredulity.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to kill me!&#8221; said he, nodding his
head.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m stared at him for a moment or two with a
look of fatigued contempt, then tore off a substantial
strip of dried flesh from the bundle hanging on the
branch, and tossed it to him. The fellow snatched it,
and hid it behind him, being too hungry to refuse it,
but too savage to eat it under his captor&#8217;s eye. Gr&ocirc;m
smiled slowly, and fell to playing with a heavy strand
of A-ya&#8217;s hair which had fallen over his arm. But to
this caress the girl paid no attention. She was puzzled
and outraged at Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s action in protecting his rival.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
Her nostrils dilated, and a red spot glowed angrily
under each cheek-bone.</p>
<p>Suddenly from down the trail came a noise of cracking
grass-stems. The two lions got up from their meal,
and turned their heads inquiringly toward the sound.
The next moment they went stalking off the opposite
way with an air of haughty indignation, ignoring all
the bodies of the slain pig-tapirs. When they had
rounded the first turn in the trail they leaped into the
grass, and went bounding off in a straight line toward
a large patch of wood some miles distant. The
wounded megatherium was returning.</p>
<p>Perhaps stung into restlessness by the anguish of
that rending thrust, the monster came dragging herself
back toward the tree, crawling on the sides of her
feet. Arriving at the scene of battle, she sniffed once
more at her mangled young one, and brayed piteously
over it. Then turning in an explosive fury upon the
body of the rhinoceros, began to tear it limb from
limb as one might pull apart a roast pigeon. While
thus occupied, she chanced to turn her eyes upon the
tree, and caught sight of the three figures looking down
upon her.</p>
<p>On the instant her rage was diverted to them. Braying
like a steam siren, she came under the tree, reared
herself against it, flung her giant arms about it,
and strove to pull it down. The tree rocked as if
struck by a tornado; and Mawg, who had been too
slow to notice what was about to happen, gave a yell
of horror as he barely saved himself from falling.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
The girl laughed, whereupon he shot her a menacing
look which so enraged her that she raised her spear
as if to transfix him.</p>
<p>But there was too much happening below for her
attention to remain on Mawg. Finding the tree quite
too sturdy to be pulled down off-hand, the monster
gripped the lowest main branch, a limb eight or ten
inches through, and with one wrench peeled it down
like a stalk of celery. Her first effort, upon the main
trunk, had set the blood once more pumping from her
wound, but she paid no attention to it. Reaching to
the next great branch, she ripped that one down also,
taking another great strip from the main trunk. Gr&ocirc;m
saw that her purpose obviously was to pull the tree to
pieces bit by bit, in order to get at her intended victims.
Mawg apparently saw this also, and it was too much
for him. Gripping his strip of dried meat between his
teeth, he slipped around the trunk till he was sheltered
from the monster&#8217;s sight, dropped to a branch which
stretched far over the water, ran out along it nimbly
as an ape, and dived. The monster, her eyes fixed
upon the two remaining in the tree, never noticed his
escape. Mawg swam the creek, thrust his way through
the grass-stems, darted back to snatch up his club, shook
it at Gr&ocirc;m, and, yelling an obscene taunt, raced off to
seek himself another retreat before nightfall.</p>
<p>Neither Gr&ocirc;m nor A-ya had any heed to spare him
at that moment. The monster had just torn down a
limb so huge that the main trunk was almost split
in half by its loss. Gr&ocirc;m saw that unless he could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
stop this process of destruction, in a few moments more
the tree would be overthrown. The monster was just
rearing herself to clutch the next great bough. Spear
in hand, Gr&ocirc;m slipped down to meet her, and halted on
a branch just out of reach. The monster brayed
vindictively, stretched to her full height, and then
shot forth her tremendous muscular red coil of tongue,
thinking evidently to lick down her insignificant adversary
from his perch. She was within an inch of
succeeding. Gr&ocirc;m just eluded the strange attack by
stepping aside nimbly; and quick as thought A-ya&#8217;s
spear slashed the dreadful red tongue as it reached
flickering after her lord&#8217;s ankles. The next moment,
seeing the monster&#8217;s throat upstretched and unguarded,
Gr&ocirc;m drove his spear full force, straight into the soft
hollow of it. The weapon sank into a depth of perhaps
three feet, till the ragged flint lodged in the vertebr&aelig;
of the monster&#8217;s neck. Then the shaft was wrenched
violently from his hand; and the monster, blowing
blood and foam from mouth and nostrils, fell with a
crash among the litter of great branches which she
had pulled down.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m drew a deep breath of relief, and commended
the girl for her timely and effective stroke at that
terrible tongue. Then he set himself coolly to the task
of completing their shelter for the night. As he wove
leafy branches into the floor of the platform to make
it soft, she contemplated his work with satisfaction.
Presently he remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad we are rid of that Mawg.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You should have killed him!&#8221; said the girl curtly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221; demanded Gr&ocirc;m, in some surprise. In
his eyes the fellow was a valuable piece of property
belonging to the tribe, a fighting asset.</p>
<p>&#8220;He wants <i>me</i>!&#8221; answered the girl, meeting his eyes
resentfully.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m let his eyes roam all over her&ndash;&ndash;face, hair
and form&ndash;&ndash;and such a look of passionate admiration
glowed in their steady depths that her anger faded,
her own eyes dropped, and her breast gave a happy, incomprehensible
flutter. She had never seen such a
look in any man&#8217;s face before, or even dreamed of such
a look as possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, he wants you,&#8221; said Gr&ocirc;m, wondering,
as he spoke, at the ring of his own voice. &#8220;You are
the fairest thing, and the most desirable, on earth. All
men whose eyes come to rest on you must want you.
But none shall have you, ever, for you are mine, and
none shall tear you from me.&#8221;</p>
<p>And at that the girl forgot her anger, and forgave
him for having neglected to kill Mawg.</p>
<p>That night sleep was impossible for them, though
their lofty shelter was comfortable and secure. A
vast orange moon, near the full, illuminated the spacious
landscape; and beneath the tree came all the
giant night-prowlers, gathering to the unparallelled
banquet which the day had spread for them. Only
the two black lions, perhaps already glutted, did not
come. Wolves, a small pack of self-disciplined wild
dogs, a troop of hyenas, and several enormous leopards,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
howled, snarled and wrangled in knots over the widely
scattered carcases, each group watching its neighbors
with suspicion and deadly animosity.</p>
<p>A gigantic red bear came lumbering up, and all the
lesser prowlers scattered discreetly but resentfully
before him. He strode straight to the chief place,
under the rent, dishevelled tree, and fell to tearing at
the mountainous corpse of the megatherium. He was
undisturbed till two saber-tooths arrived, their tawny
coats spectral in the moonlight, their foot-long tusks
giving their broad masks a dreadful grin.</p>
<p>Before one saber-tooth the bear would have stood
his ground scornfully; but before the two he thought
it best to defer. Slowly, and with a thunderous grumbling,
he moved over to the body of the rhinoceros,
pretending that he preferred it. The air was split
and battered with the clamor of raving voices. Other
saber-tooths came, and then another bear.</p>
<p>There were swift, sudden battles, as swiftly dropped
because neither combatant wished to fight to a finish
when there was feasting so abundant for all. And
once a leopard, dodging the paw of a saber-tooth,
sprang into the tree, only to fall back howling from
the spears thrust at him through the floor of Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s
platform.</p>
<p>Just before dawn the girl slept, while Gr&ocirc;m kept
watch beside her lest another leopard should fancy
to explore their refuge. An hour later, when the first
pallor was spreading, she awoke with a cry of fear,
and clung to Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s arm, shuddering strongly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;what is it?&#8221; he asked, in a tender voice,
stroking her heavy mane.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was afraid!&#8221; she answered, like a child.</p>
<p>&#8220;What were you afraid of?&#8221; asked Gr&ocirc;m.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was afraid of Mawg. I <i>am</i> afraid of him!&#8221; she
answered, sitting up and shaking the hair from her
eyes, and staring out fearfully over the gray transparent
plains.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should you fear Mawg?&#8221; demanded Gr&ocirc;m
proudly. &#8220;Am not I your man? And am not I always
with you? Many such mad brutes as Mawg could not
take you from me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; answered the girl, &#8220;that he and such as
he would be as straws in my lord&#8217;s hands. But&ndash;&ndash;even
Gr&ocirc;m must sometimes sleep!&#8221;</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m laughed gently at her forebodings.</p>
<p>&#8220;He must sleep now, indeed, for we have a long
and perilous journey before us,&#8221; said he. Laying his
great shaggy head in her lap, and stretching his limbs
as far as the tiny platform would allow he was asleep
in two seconds. The girl, stooping forward till her
rich hair shadowed the rugged, sleeping face, with its
calm brows, pondered deeply over his inexplicable forbearance
toward his rival. Her instincts all assured
her that it was dangerous; but something else within
her, something which she strove in vain to grasp, suggested
to her that in some way it was noble, and
made her glad of it. Then, all at once, the first of
the sunrise, flooding into the tree-top, bathed her face
with a rosy glow, and wonderfully transfigured it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>THE BATTLE OF THE BRANDS</h3>
</div>
<p style='text-align:center;'>I</p>
<p>Now for two years had the remnants of the
tribe been settled in the Valley of Fire. They
had prospered exceedingly. The caves were swarming
with strong children; for at the Chief&#8217;s orders every
warrior had taken to himself either two or three wives,
so that none of the widows had been left unmated.
Gr&ocirc;m alone remained with but one wife, although
his position in the tribe, second only to that of Bawr
himself, would have entitled him to as many as he
might choose.</p>
<p>Singularly happy with the girl A-ya, Gr&ocirc;m had been
unwilling to receive other women into their little grotto,
which branched off from the high arched entrance of
the main cave. He might, however, have yielded, from
policy and for the sake of the tribe, to pressure from
the Chief, but for a look of startled anguish which he
had seen leap into A-ya&#8217;s eyes when he mentioned the
matter to her. This had surprised him at the moment,
but it had also thrilled him curiously. And as the girl
made no objection to a step so absolutely in accordance
with the tribal customs, Gr&ocirc;m thought about it a good
deal. A few days later he excused himself to the
Chief, saying that other women in his cave would be a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
nuisance, and would interfere with those studies of the
Shining One which had proved so beneficial to the tribe.
Bawr had accepted the excuse, though somewhat perplexed
by it, and had accommodatingly taken the extra
wives himself&ndash;&ndash;a solution which had seemed to meet
with the unqualified approval of A-ya.</p>
<p>The first winter in the Valley of Fire had been a
wonderful one to the tribe, thanks to the fierce but
beneficent element ever shining, dancing and whispering
in its mysterious tongue before the cave doors.
Bleak winds and driving, icy rains out of the north had
no longer any power to distress them.</p>
<p>But when the storm was violent, with drenching and
persistent rain, then it was found necessary to feed the
fires before the cave-mouths lavishly with dry fuel
from the stores which Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s forethought had caused
to be accumulated under shelter. These contests
between fire and rain were sagaciously represented by
Bawr (who had by now to his authority as Chief added
the subtle sanctions of High Priest) as the fight of the
Shining One in protection of the tribe, his children.</p>
<p>On more than one occasion of torrential downpour
the struggle had almost seemed to hang for a while
in doubt. But the Shining One lost no prestige, thereby,
for always, down there across the valley-mouth,
kept leaping and dancing those unquenchable flames of
scarlet, amber and violet, fed by the volcanic gases from
within the crevice, and utterly regardless of whatever
floods the sky might loose upon them. This was
evidence conclusive that the Shining One was master
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
of the storm, no less than of the monsters which fled
so terror-stricken before him.</p>
<p>In the early spring, the girl A-ya bore a child to
Gr&ocirc;m; a big-limbed, vigorous boy, with shapely head
and spacious brow. In this event, and in the mother&#8217;s
happiness about it (a happiness that seemed to the rest
of the women to savor of foolish extravagance),
Gr&ocirc;m felt a gladness which dignity forbade him to
betray.</p>
<p>But pondering over the little one with bent brows,
and with deep eyes full of visions, he conceived such
an ambition as had perhaps never before entered into
the heart of man. It was that this child might grow
up to achieve some wonderful thing, as he himself had
done, for the advancement of his people. Of this
baby, child of the woman toward whom he felt emotions
so new and so profound, he had a premonition
that new and incalculable things would come.</p>
<p>One day Gr&ocirc;m was following the trail of a deer some
distance up the valley. Skilled hunter that he was,
he could read in the trail that his quarry was not
far ahead, and also that it had not yet taken alarm.
He followed cautiously, up the wind, noiseless as a
leopard, his sagacious eyes taking note of every detail
about him.</p>
<p>Presently he came to a spot where the trail was
broken. There was a twenty-foot gap to the next
hoofprints, and these went off at right angles to the
direction which the quarry had hitherto been pursuing.
Gr&ocirc;m halted abruptly, slipped behind a tree, crouched,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
and peered about him with the tense vigilance of a
startled fox. He knew that something had frightened
the deer, and frightened it badly. It behooved him to
find out what that something was.</p>
<p>For some minutes he stood motionless as the trunk
against which he leant, searching every bush and thicket
with his keen gaze, and sniffing the air with expert
nostrils. There was nothing perceptible to explain
that sudden fright of the deer. He was on the point
of slipping around the trunk to investigate from another
angle. But stop! There on a patch of soil
where some bear had been grubbing for tubers he
detected a strange footprint. Instantly, he sank to
the ground, and wormed his way over, silently as a
snake, to examine it.</p>
<p>It was a human footprint, but much larger than his
own, or those of his tribe; and Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s beard, and the
stiff hairs on the nape of his corded neck, bristled with
hostility at the sight of it.</p>
<p>The toes of this portentous print were immensely
long and muscular, the heel protruded grotesquely far
behind the arch of the foot, which was low and flat.
The pressure was very marked along all the outer
edge, as if the author of the print had walked on the
outer sides of his feet. To Gr&ocirc;m, who was an adept
in the signs of the trail, it needed no second look to be
informed that one of the Bow-legs had been here.
And the trail was not five minutes old.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m slipped under the nearest bushes, and writhed
forward with amazing speed in the direction indicated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
by the strange footprint, pausing every other second
to look, sniff the air, and listen. The trail was as
clear as daylight to him. Suddenly he heard voices,
several of them, guttural and squealing, and stopped
again as if turned to stone. Then another voice, at
which he started in amazement. It was Mawg&#8217;s,
speaking quietly and confidentially. Mawg, then, had
gone over to the Bow-legs! Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s forehead
wrinkled. A-ya had been right. He ought to have
killed the traitor. He writhed himself into a dense
covert, and presently, over the broken brink of a vine-draped
ledge, was able to command a view of the
speakers.</p>
<p>They were five in number, and grouped almost immediately
below him. Four were of the Bow-legs,
squat, huge in the shoulder, long-armed, flat-skulled,
of a yellowish clay color, with protruding jaws, and
gaping, pit-like, upturned nostrils to their wide, bridgeless
noses. Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s own nose wrinkled in disgust as
the sour taint of them breathed up to him.</p>
<p>They were all armed with spears and stone-headed
clubs, such as their people had been unacquainted with
up to the time of their attack upon the Tribe of the
Little Hills. It was apparent to Gr&ocirc;m that the
renegade Mawg, who towered among them arrogantly,
had been teaching them what he knew of effective
weapons.</p>
<p>Having no remotest comprehension of the language
of the Bow-legs&ndash;&ndash;which Mawg was speaking with
them&ndash;&ndash;Gr&ocirc;m could get little clue to the drift of their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
talk. They gesticulated frequently toward the east,
and then again toward the caves at the valley-mouth,
so Gr&ocirc;m guessed readily enough that they were planning
something against his people.</p>
<p>It was clear, also, that this was but a little scouting
party which the renegade had led in to spy upon the
weakness of the tribe. This was as far as he could
premise with any certainty. The obvious conclusion
was that these spies would return to their own country,
to lead back such an invasion as should blot the
Children of the Shining One out of existence.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m was quick to realize that to listen any longer
was to waste invaluable time. All that it was possible
for him to learn, he had learned. Writhing softly
back till he had gained what he considered a safe
distance from the spies, he rose to his feet and ran, at
first noiselessly, and crouching as he went, then at the
top of that speed for which he was famous in the
tribe. Reaching the Caves, he laid the matter hurriedly
before the Chief, and within five minutes they were
leading a dozen warriors up the trail.</p>
<p>Besides their customary weapons, both Gr&ocirc;m and
the Chief carried fire-sticks, tubes of thick, green bark,
tied round with a raw hide, filled with smouldering
punk, and perforated with a number of holes toward
the upper end. This was one of Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s inventions,
of proved efficacy against saber-tooth and bear. By
cramming a handful of dry fiber and twigs into the
mouth of the tube, and then whirling it around his
head, he was able to obtain a sudden and most unexpected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
burst of flame which no beast ever dared to face,
and which never failed to compel the awe and wonder
of his followers.</p>
<p>Like shadows the little band went gliding in single
file through the thickets and under the drooping
branches, their passage marked only by the occasional
upspringing of a startled bird or the frightened crashing
flight of some timorous beast surprised by their
swift and noiseless approach. Arriving near the
hollow under the ledge, they sank flat and wormed
their way forward like weasels till they had gained the
post of observation behind the vine-clad rock.</p>
<p>But the strangers had vanished. An examination
of their footprints showed that they had fled in haste;
and to Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s chagrin it looked as if he had himself
given them the alarm. The problem was solved in a
few minutes by the discovery that Mawg&ndash;&ndash;easily detected
by his finer footprints&ndash;&ndash;had scaled the ledge and
come upon the place where Gr&ocirc;m had lain hidden to
watch them. Seeing that they were discovered, and
that their discoverer had evidently gone to arouse the
tribe, they had realized that, the Bow-legs being slow
runners, their only hope lay in instant flight. From the
direction which they had taken it was evident that they
were fleeing back to their own country.</p>
<p>The Chief ordered instant pursuit. To this Gr&ocirc;m
demurred, not only because the fugitives had obtained
such a start&ndash;&ndash;as was shown by the state of the trail&ndash;&ndash;but
because he dreaded to leave the Caves so long unguarded.
He foresaw the possibility of another band
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
of invaders surprising the Caves during the absence
of this most efficient fighting force. But the Chief
overruled him.</p>
<p>For several hours was the pursuit kept up; and
from the trail it appeared, not only that Mawg was
leading his followers cleverly, but also that the Bow-legs
were making no mean speed. The pursuers were
come by now to near the head of the valley, a region
with which they were little familiar. It was a broken
country and well fitted for ambuscade, where a lesser
force, well posted and driven to bay, might well secure
a deadly advantage. The tribe was too weak to risk
its few fighting men in any uncertain contest; and
the Chief, yielding slowly to Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s arguments, was
on the point of giving the order to turn back, when
a harsh scream of terror from just ahead, beyond a
shoulder of rock, brought the line to a halt.</p>
<p>Waving their followers into concealment on either
side of the trail, the Chief and Gr&ocirc;m stole forward
and peered cautiously around the turn.</p>
<p>Straight before them fell away a steep and rugged
slope. Midway of the descent, with his back to a
rock, crouched one of the Bow-legs, battling frantically
with his club to keep off the attack of a pair of
leopards. The man was kneeling upon one knee, with
the other leg trailed awkwardly behind him. It seemed
an altogether difficult and disadvantageous position in
which to do battle.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fool!&#8221; said Bawr. &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t know how to
fight a leopard.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s hurt. His leg is broken!&#8221; said Gr&ocirc;m. And
straightway, a novel purpose flashing into his far-seeing
brain, he ran leaping down the slope to the rescue,
waving his fire-stick to a blaze as he went.</p>
<p>The Chief looked puzzled for a moment, wondering
why the deliberate Gr&ocirc;m should trouble to do what it
was plain the leopards would do for him most effectually.
But he dreaded the chance of an ambuscade.
Shouting to the men behind to come on, he waved his
own fire-stick to a blaze, and followed Gr&ocirc;m.</p>
<p>One of the leopards had already succeeded in closing
in upon the wounded Bow-leg; but at the sight of Gr&ocirc;m
and the Chief leaping down upon them they sprang
back snarling and scurried off among the thickets like
frightened cats. The Bow-leg lifted wild eyes to learn
the meaning of his deliverance. But when he saw those
two tall forms rushing at him with flame and smoke
circling about their heads, he gave a groan and fell
forward upon his face.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m stood over him, staring down upon the misshapen
and bleeding form with thoughtful eyes; while
the Chief looked on, striving to fathom his purpose.
The warriors came up, shouting savage delight at
having at last got one of their dreaded enemies into
their hands alive. They would have fallen upon him
at once and torn him to pieces. But Gr&ocirc;m waved them
back sternly. They growled with indignation, and
one, sufficiently prominent in the tribal counsels to dare
Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s displeasure, protested hotly against this favor
to so venomous a foe.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I demand this fellow, Bawr, as my captive!&#8221; said
Gr&ocirc;m.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was you who took him,&#8221; answered the Chief.
&#8220;He is yours.&#8221; He was about to add, &#8220;though I can&#8217;t
see what you want of him&#8221;; but it was a part of his
policy never to seem in doubt or ignorance about anything
that another might perhaps know. So, instead,
he sternly told his followers to obey the law of the
tribe and respect Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s capture. Then Gr&ocirc;m stepped
close beside him and said at his ear: &#8220;Many things
which we need to know will Bawr learn from this
fellow presently, as to the dangers which are like to
come upon us.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this the Chief, being ready of wit, comprehended
Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s purpose; and, to the amazement of his followers,
he looked down upon the hideous prisoner with
a smile of satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well have I called you the Chief&#8217;s Right Hand,&#8221;
he answered. &#8220;I shall also have to call you the Chief&#8217;s
Wisdom, for in saving this fellow&#8217;s life you have
shown more forethought than I.&#8221;</p>
<p>The captive&#8217;s wounds having been dressed with
astringent herbs, and his broken leg put into splints
in accordance with the rude but not ineffective surgery
of the time, he was placed on a rough litter of interlaced
branches and carried back by the reluctant
warriors to the Caves.</p>
<p>None of the warriors were advanced enough to
have understood the policy of their leaders, so no
effort was made by either the Chief or Gr&ocirc;m to explain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
it. The Chief, doubly secure in his dominance by
reason of Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s loyal support, cared little whether his
followers were content or not, and he took no heed of
their ill-humor so long as they did not allow it to become
articulate.</p>
<p>But when, after an hour&#8217;s sullen tramping, they
suddenly grew merry at their task, and fell to marching
with a child-like cheer under their repulsive and
groaning burden, he was surprised, and made inquiry
as to the reason for this sudden complaisance. It
turned out that one of the warriors, accounted more
discerning than his fellows, had suggested that the
captive was to be nursed back to health in order that
he might be made an acceptable sacrifice to the Shining
One. As this notion seemed to meet with such
hearty approval, the wise Chief did not think it worth
while to cast any doubt upon it. In fact, as he thought,
such a solution might very well arrive, in the end, in
case Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s design should fail to come up to his expectations.</p>
<p>To the presence of the hideous and repulsive stranger
in her dwelling, A-ya, as was natural, raised warm objection.
But when Gr&ocirc;m had explained his purpose
to her, and the imminence of the peril that threatened,
she yielded readily enough, the dread of Mawg being
yet vivid in her imagination. She lent herself cheerfully
to the duty of caring for the captive&#8217;s wounds and
of helping Gr&ocirc;m to teach him the simple speech of the
tribe.</p>
<p>As for the captive, for some days he was possessed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
by a morose anticipation of being brained at any moment&ndash;&ndash;an
anticipation, however, which did not seem
to interfere with his appetite. He would clutch eagerly
all the food offered him, and crouch, huddled over
it, with his face to the rock-wall, while he devoured it
with frantic haste and bestial noises. But as he found
himself treated with invariable kindness, he began to
develop an anxious gratitude and docility. On A-ya&#8217;s
tall form his little round eyes, shy and fierce at the same
time, came to rest with an adoring awe. The smell
of him being extremely offensive to all this cleanly tribe,
and especially to A-ya and Gr&ocirc;m, who were more fastidious
than their fellows, A-ya had taken advantage
of her office as priestess of the Shining One to establish
a little fire within the precincts of her own dwelling,
and by the judicious use of aromatic barks upon
the blaze she was able to scent the place to her taste.
And the Bow-leg, seeing her mastery of the mysterious
and dreadful scarlet tongues which licked upwards
from the hollow on their rocky pedestal, regarded her
less as a woman than as a goddess&ndash;&ndash;a being who, for
her own unknown reasons, chose to be beneficent toward
him, but who plainly could become destructive if
he should in any way transgress. Toward Gr&ocirc;m&ndash;&ndash;who
regarded him altogether impersonally as a means
to an end, a pawn to be played prudently in a game of
vast import&ndash;&ndash;his attitude was that of the submitted
slave, his fate lying in the hollow of his master&#8217;s hand.
Toward the rest of the tribe&ndash;&ndash;who, till their curiosity
was sated, kept crowding in to stare and jeer and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
curse&ndash;&ndash;he displayed the savage fear and hate of a lynx
at bay.</p>
<p>But the babe on A-ya&#8217;s arm seemed to him something
peculiarly precious. It was not only the son of
Gr&ocirc;m, his grave and distant master, but also of that
wonderful, beautiful, enigmatic deity, his mistress,
the fashioner and controller of the flames. The adoration
which soon grew up in his heart for A-ya&#8217;s beauty,
but which his awe of her did not suffer him even to
realize to himself, was turned upon the babe, and
speedily took the form of a passionate and dog-like
devotion. A-ya, with her mother instinct, was quick
to understand this, and also to realize the possible value
to her child of such a devotion, in some future
emergency. Moreover, it softened her heart toward
the hideous captive, so that she busied herself not only
to help Gr&ocirc;m teach him their language, but also to
reform his manners and make him somewhat less unpleasant
an associate. His wounds soon healed, thanks
to the vitality of his youthful stock; and the bones
of the broken leg soon knit themselves securely. But
Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s surgery having been hasty and something less
than exact, the leg remained so crooked that its owner
could do no more than hobble about with a laborious,
dragging gait. It being obvious that he could not
run away, there was no guard set upon him.</p>
<p>But it soon became equally obvious that nothing
would induce him to remove himself from the neighborhood
of A-ya&#8217;s baby. He was like a gigantic watchdog
squatting at Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s doorway, chained to it by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
links stronger than any that hands could fashion. And
those of the tribe who had been hoping to do honor to
the Shining One, as well as to the spirits of their
slain kinsmen back in the barrow on the windy hills,
by a great and bloody sacrifice, began to realize with
discontent that their hopes were like enough to be
disappointed.</p>
<p style='text-align:center;margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1em;'>II</p>
<p>The captive said his name was Ook-ootsk&ndash;&ndash;a clicking
guttural which none but A-ya was able to master.
When he had learned to make himself understood, he
proved eager to repay Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s protection by giving
all the information that he possessed. Simple-minded,
but with much of a child&#8217;s shrewdness, he quickly
came to regard himself as of some importance when
both the Chief and Gr&ocirc;m would spend hours in interrogating
him. His own people he repudiated with
bitterness, because, when he had fallen among the
rocks and shattered his leg, his party had refused to
burden their flight by helping him. It became his
pride to identify himself with the interests of his
master, and to call himself the slave of his master&#8217;s
baby.</p>
<p>The information which he was able to give was such
as to cause the Chief and Gr&ocirc;m the most profound disquietude.
It appeared that the Bow-legs, having
gradually recovered from the panic of their appalling
defeat in the Pass of the Little Hills, had made up
their minds that the disaster must be avenged. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
no longer did they hold their opponents cheap on account
of their scanty numbers. They realized that
if they would hope to succeed in their next attack they
must organize, and prepare themselves by learning how
to employ their forces better. To this end, therefore,
when Mawg and his fellow-renegades fell into their
hands, instead of tearing them to pieces in bestial
sport, they had spared them, and made much of them,
and set themselves diligently to learn all that the
strangers could teach. And Mawg, seeing here his
opportunity both for vengeance on Gr&ocirc;m and for the
gratification of that mad passion for A-ya which had
so long obsessed him, had gone about the business with
shrewd foresight and a convincing zeal.</p>
<p>It was apparent from the accounts which Ook-ootsk
was able to give that the invasion would take place
as soon as possible after their hordes were adequately
armed with the new weapons. This, said Ook-ootsk,
would be soon after the dry season had set in. In
any case, he said, the hordes were bound to wait for
the dry season, because the way from their country
to the Valley of Fire lay through a region of swamps
which became impassable for any large body of
migrants during the month of rains.</p>
<p>As the dry season was already close upon them,
Bawr and Gr&ocirc;m now set themselves feverishly to the
arrangement of their defenses. Counting the older
boys who had grown into sizable youths since the
last great battle and all the able-bodied women and
girls, they could muster no more than about six score
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
of actual combatants. They knew that defeat would
mean nothing less than instant annihilation for the
tribe, and for the women a foul captivity and a loathsome
mating. But they knew also that a mere successful
defense would avail them only for the moment.
Unless they could inflict upon the invaders such a defeat
as would amount to a paralyzing catastrophe, they
would soon be worn down by mere force of numbers,
or starved to death in their caves. It was not only
for defense, therefore, but for wholesale attack&ndash;&ndash;the
attack of six score upon as many thousand&ndash;&ndash;that Bawr
planned his strategy and Gr&ocirc;m wove unheard-of devices.</p>
<p>Of the two great caves occupied by the tribe one
was now abandoned, as not lending itself easily to
defense. To Bawr&#8217;s battle-trained eyes it revealed
itself as rather a trap than a refuge, because from the
heights behind it an enemy could roll down rocks
enough to effectively block its mouth. But the cliff
in which the other cave was hollowed was practically
inaccessible, and hung beetling far over the entrance.</p>
<p>Into this natural fortress the tribe&ndash;&ndash;with an infinite
deal of grumbling&ndash;&ndash;was removed. Store of roots and
dried flesh was gathered within; and every one was
set to the collection of dry and half-dry fuel. The
light stuff, with an immense number of short, highly-inflammable
faggots, was piled inside the doorway
where no rain could reach it. And the heavy wood
was stacked outside, to right and left, in such a fashion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
as to form practical ramparts for the innermost line
of defense.</p>
<p>Directly in front of the cave spread a small fan-shaped
plateau several hundred square yards in area.
On the right a narrow path, wide enough for but one
wayfarer at a time, descended between perpendicular
boulders to the second cave. On the left the plateau
was bordered by broken ground, a jumble of serrated
rocks, to be traversed only with difficulty. In front
there was a steep but shallow dip, from which the land
sloped gently up the valley, clothed with high bush
and deep thickets intersected with innumerable narrow
trails.</p>
<p>Directly in front of the cave, and about the center
of the plateau, burned always, night and day, the
sacred fire, tended in turn by the members of the little
band appointed to this distinguished service by the
Chief. Under the Chief&#8217;s direction the whole of the
plateau was now cleared of underbrush and grass,
and then along its brink was laid a chain of small fires,
some ten or twelve feet apart, and all ready for lighting.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gr&ocirc;m was busy preparing the device
on which, according to his plan of campaign, the
ultimate issue was to hang. For days the tribe was
kept on the stretch collecting dry and leafy brushwood
from the other side of the valley, and bundles of dead
grass from the rich savannahs beyond the valley-mouth,
on the other side of the dancing flames. All
this inflammable stuff Gr&ocirc;m distributed lavishly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
through the thickets before the plateau, to a distance
of nearly a mile up the slope, till the whole space was
in reality one vast bonfire laid ready for the torch.</p>
<p>While these preparations were being rushed&ndash;&ndash;somewhat
to the perplexity of the tribe, who could not
fathom the tactics of stuffing the landscape with rubbish&ndash;&ndash;Bawr
was keeping a little band of scouts on
guard at the far-off head of the valley. They were
chosen from the swift runners of the tribe; and Bawr,
who was a far-seeing general, had them relieved twice
in twenty-four hours, that they might not grow weary
and fail in vigilance.</p>
<p>When all was ready came a time of trying suspense.
As day after day rolled by without event, cloudless
and hot, the country became as dry as tinder; and the
tribe, seeing that nothing unusual happened, began to
doubt or to forget the danger that hung over them.
There were murmurs over the strain of ceaseless watching,
murmurs which Bawr suppressed with small
ceremony. But the lame Ook-ootsk, squatting misshapen
in Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s doorway with A-ya&#8217;s baby in his ape-like
arms grew more and more anxious. As he conveyed
to Gr&ocirc;m, the longer the delay the greater the
force which was being gathered for the assault.</p>
<p>Having no inkling of Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s larger designs, he
looked with distrust on the little heaps of wood that
were to be fires along the edge of the plateau, and
wished them to be piled much bigger, intimating that
his people, though they would be terribly afraid of
the Shining One, would be forced on from behind by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
sheer numbers and would trample the small fires out.
The confidence of the Chief and Gr&ocirc;m, and of A-ya
as well, in the face of the awful peril which hung over
them, filled him with amazement.</p>
<p>Then, at last, one evening just in the dying flush
of the sunset, came the scouts, running breathlessly,
and one with a ragged spear-wound in his shoulder.
Their eyes were wide as they told of the countless
myriads of the Bow-legs who were pouring into the
head of the valley, led by Mawg and a gigantic black-faced
chief as tall as Bawr himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are they as many,&#8221; asked Gr&ocirc;m, &#8220;as they who came
against us in the Little Hills?&#8221;</p>
<p>But the panting men threw up their hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a swarm of locusts to a flock of starlings,&#8221; they
replied.</p>
<p>To their astonishment the Chief smiled with grim
satisfaction at this appalling news.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is well,&#8221; said he. Mounting a rock by the cave-door,
he gazed up the valley, striving to make out the
vanguard of the approaching hordes; while Gr&ocirc;m, marshalling
the servitors of the fire, stationed them by the
range of piles, ready to set light to them on the given
word.</p>
<p>It was nearly an hour&ndash;&ndash;so swift had been the terror
of the scouts&ndash;&ndash;before a low, terrible sound of crashings
and mutterings announced that the hordes were drawing
near. It was now twilight, with the first stars
appearing in a pallid violet sky; and up the valley
could be discerned an obscurely rolling confusion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
among the thickets. Bawr gave orders, rapid and
concise; and the combatants lined out in a double rank
along the front of the plateau some three or four paces
behind the piles of wood.</p>
<p>They were armed with stone-headed clubs, large or
small, according to personal taste, and each carried at
least three flint-tipped spears. At the head of the
narrow path leading up from the lower cave were
stationed half a dozen women, similarly armed. Bawr
had chosen these women because each of them had one
or more young children in the cave behind her; and
he knew that no adventurous foe would get up that
path alive. But A-ya was not among these six wild
mothers, for her place was at the service of the fires.</p>
<p>The ominous roar and that obscure confusion rolled
swiftly nearer, and Bawr, with a swing of his huge
club, sprang down from his post of observation and
strode to the front. Gr&ocirc;m shouted an order, and
light was set to all the crescent of fires. They flared
up briskly; and at the same time the big central fire,
which had been allowed to sink to a heap of glowing
coals, was heaped with dry stuff which sent up an
instant column of flame. The sudden wide illumination,
shed some hundreds of yards up the valley, revealed
the front ranks of the Bow-legs swarming in
the brush, their hideous yellow faces, gaping nostrils
and pig-like eyes all turned up in awe towards the
glare.</p>
<p>The advance of the front ranks came to an instant
halt, and the low muttering rose to a chorus of harsh
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
cries. Then the tall figure of Mawg sprang to the
front, followed, after a moment of wondering hesitation,
by that of the head chief of the hordes, a massive
creature of the true Bow-leg type, but as tall as Bawr
himself, and in color almost black. This giant and
Mawg, refusing to be awed by the tremendous phenomenon
of the fire, went leaping along the lines of their
followers, urging them forward, and pointing out that
their enemies stood close beside the flames and took no
hurt.</p>
<p>On the front ranks themselves this reasoning seemed,
at first, to produce little effect. But to those just
behind it appeared more cogent, seconded as it was by
a consuming curiosity. Moreover, the masses in the
rear were rolling down, and their pressure presently
became irresistible. All at once the front ranks realized
that they had no choice in the matter. They
sagged forward, surged obstinately back again, then
gave like a bursting dam and poured, yelling and leaping,
straight onward toward the crescent of fires.</p>
<p>As soon as the rush was fairly begun, both Mawg
and the Black Chief cleverly extricated themselves
from it, running aside to the higher, broken ground at
the left of the plateau whence they could see and direct
the attack. It was plain enough that they accounted
the front ranks doomed, and were depending on sheer
weight of numbers for the inevitable victory.</p>
<p>Standing grim, silent, immovable between their fires,
the Chief and Gr&ocirc;m awaited the dreadful onset. In
all the tribe not a voice was raised, not a fighter, man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
or woman, quailed. But many hearts stood still, for
it looked as if that living flood could never be stayed.
Presently from all along its front came a cloud of
spears. But they fell short, not more than half a
dozen reaching the edge of the plateau. In instant
response came a deep-chested shout from Bawr, followed
by a discharge of spears from behind the line
of fire.</p>
<p>These spears, driven with free arm and practised
skill, went clean home in the packed ranks of the
foe, but they caused no more than a second&#8217;s wavering,
as the dead went down and their fellows crowded on
straight over them. A second volley from the grimly
silent fighters on the plateau had somewhat more effect.
Driven low, and at shorter range, every jagged flint-point
found its mark, and the screaming victims
hampered those behind. But after a moment the mad
flood came on again, till it was within some thirty
paces of the edge of the plateau.</p>
<p>Then came a long shout from Gr&ocirc;m, a signal
which had been anxiously awaited by the front line
of his fighters. Each fire had been laid, on the inner
side, with dry faggots of a resinous wood which not
only blazed freely but held the flame tenaciously.
These faggots had been placed with only their tips in
the fire. Seizing them by their unlighted ends, the
warriors hurled them, blazing, full into the gaping faces
before them.</p>
<p>The brutal, gaping faces screeched with pain and
terror, and the whole front rank, beating frantically
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
at the strange missiles, wheeled about and clawed at
the rank behind, battling to force its way through.
But the rolling masses were not to be denied. After
a brief, terrible struggle, the would-be fugitives were
borne down and trodden underfoot. The new-comers
were greeted with a second discharge of the blazing
brands, and the dreadful scene repeated itself. But
now there was a difference. For many of the assailants,
realizing that there was no chance of retreat,
came straight on, heedless of brand or spear, with the
deadly, uncalculating fury of a beast at bay.</p>
<p>For some seconds, under the specific directions of
the Chief on the right center and of Gr&ocirc;m far to the
left, many of the blazing brands had been thrown,
not into the faces of the front rank, but far over their
heads, to fall among the tinder-dry brushwood. Long
tongues of flame leaped up at once, here, there, everywhere,
curling and licking savagely. Screeches of
horror arose, which brought all the hordes to a halt
as far back as they could be heard. A light wind
was blowing up the valley, and almost at once the
scattered flames, gathering volume, came together with
a roar. The hordes, smitten with the blindest madness
of panic, turned to flee, springing upon and tearing
at each other in the desperate struggle to escape.</p>
<p>Shouting triumph and derision, the defenders
bounded forward, down over the edge of the plateau,
and fell upon the huddled ranks before them. But
these, with all escape cut off, and far outnumbering
their exultant adversaries, now fought like rats in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
pit. And the men of the caves found themselves locked
in a struggle to the death just when they had thought
the fight was done.</p>
<p>A-ya, no longer needed at the fires, was just about
to follow Gr&ocirc;m down into the thick of the reeking
battle, when a scream from the cave-mouth made her
whip round. She was just in time to see Ook-ootsk
hurl his spear at the tall figure of Mawg, leaping down
upon him from the broken slope on the left. A half
score of the Bow-legs were following hard upon
Mawg&#8217;s heels. With a scream of warning to Gr&ocirc;m
she rushed back to the cave. But Gr&ocirc;m did not hear
her. He had been pulled down, struck senseless and
buried under a writhing heap of foes.</p>
<p>Her long hair streaming behind her, her eyes like
those of a tigress protecting her cubs, A-ya darted to
the cave-door. But she did not reach it. Just outside
the threshold a club descended upon her head,
and she dropped. Instantly she was pounced upon,
and bound. A moment later three Bow-legs, followed
by Mawg, streaming with blood, came running out of
the cave. Mawg swung the limp form across his
shoulder with a grin of satisfaction, and the party
beat a hurried retreat up the slopes.</p>
<p>In a few minutes that last death-grapple along the
front of the plateau came to an end, and Bawr, leaving
nearly a third of his followers slain with the slain
Bow-legs, led the exultant survivors back to the cave.
It had been a costly victory for the Children of the
Shining One; but for the invaders it was little less than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
annihilation. The flames were raging for a mile up
the valley, wherever they were not choked by the piles
and windrows of the dead or dying Bow-legs. The
lurid night was shaken with the incessant rising and
falling chorus of shrieks, and far off under the glare
rolled that awful receding wave of fugitives, with the
flames leaping upon them and slaying them as they
fled. Leaning upon his club and gazing thoughtfully
across the scene of incredible destruction, Bawr told
himself that never again, so long as the memory of
this night survived, would the Bow-legs dare to come
against his people.</p>
<p>Then wild lamentation from the women drew the
Chief into the cave. Here he found that half the
little ones had been killed in that swift incursion of
Mawg, and that nearly all the old men and women had
been slaughtered in defending their charges. Across
Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s doorway, crouching on his face and with his
great teeth buried in the throat of a dead Bow-leg, lay
the lame captive, Ook-ootsk. Seeing that he still
breathed, and marking the fury with which he had
fought in defense of their little ones, the warriors
lifted him aside gently. Beneath him, and safely
guarded in the crook of his shaggy arm, they found
Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s baby, without a hurt. The women defending
the head of the path on the right having seen the rape
of A-ya, Bawr handed the babe to one of his own wives
to cherish.</p>
<p>Then search was made for Gr&ocirc;m. At first the Chief
imagined that he had followed the captors of A-ya, in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
a desperate hope of effecting her rescue alone. But
they found him under a heap of dead, so nearly dead
himself that they despaired of him. Realizing that it
was he who had saved the tribe, they began over him
that great keening lamentation hitherto reserved
strictly for the funeral of the supreme Chief himself.
But Bawr, his massive features furrowed with solicitude,
stopped them, vowing that Gr&ocirc;m should not die.
And lifting the hero in his arms he bore him into the
cave.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s wounds proved to be deep, but not fatal
to one of these clean-blooded sons of the open and the
wind. It was some days before it was clearly borne in
upon him that A-ya had been carried off alive by the
Bow-legs. Then, with a great cry, he sprang to his
feet. The blood spouted afresh from his wounds,
and he fell back in a swoon. When he came to himself
again, for days he would speak to no one, and it
looked as if he would die, not of his wounds so much as
of the insufficient will to live. But a chance word of
the captive Ook-ootsk, who was being nursed back
to life beside him, reminded him that there was vengeance
to be lived for, and he roused himself a little.
Then Bawr, ever subtle in the reading of his people&#8217;s
hearts, suggested to him that even such a feat as the
rescue of the girl A-ya might not be impossible to the
subjugator of the fire and the slayer of a whole people.</p>
<p>And from that moment Gr&ocirc;m began climbing steadily
back to life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>THE RESCUE OF A-YA</h3>
</div>
<p>The clay-colored, ape-like, bow-legged men
squatted in council.</p>
<p>It was not long, as time went in the long, slow
morning of the world&ndash;&ndash;perhaps a half-score thousand
years or so&ndash;&ndash;since their ancestors, in the pride of their
dawning intelligence, had swung down from their
tree-tops, to walk upright on the solid earth and
challenge the supremacy of the hunting beasts. Their
arms were still of an unhuman and ungainly length,
their short powerful legs were still so heavily bowed
that they had no great speed in running; and they still
had their homes high among the branches, where they
could sleep secure from surprise. They were still tree
dwellers; but they were men, intent upon asserting their
lordship over all the other dwellers upon earth&#8217;s surface.</p>
<p>They were not beautiful to look upon. Their squat,
powerful forms, varying in color from a dingy yellow-brown
to blackish mud-color, were covered unevenly
with a thin growth of dark hairs. On thigh and
shoulder, down the backbone, and on the outer side of
the long forearm, this growth was heavier and longer,
forming a sort of irregular thatch; while the hair of
their heads was jet black, and matted into a filthy
tangle with grease and clay. Their faces were broad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
and flat, with powerful protruding jaws, low and very
receding foreheads, and wide noses which seemed to
have been punched in at the bridge so that the flaring
red nostrils turned upwards hideously.</p>
<p>It was but a battered and crestfallen remnant of the
tribe which now took counsel over their diminished
fortunes. In an irregular half-circle they squatted,
pawing gingerly at their wounds or scratching themselves
uncouthly, while their apish women loitered in
chattering groups outside the circle, or crouched in the
branches of the neighboring trees. Those who were
perched in the trees mostly held babies at their breasts,
and were therefore instinctively distrustful of the
dangerous ground-levels. Here and there on the outskirts
of the crowd, either squatting on hillocks or
clinging in a tree-top, wary-eyed old women kept watch
against surprise; though there were few among either
beasts or men who would be likely to venture an attack
upon the ferocious tribe of the Bow-legs.</p>
<p>On a low, flat-topped bowlder, which served the
purpose of a throne, sat the Chief of the Bow-legs,
playing with his unwieldy club (which was merely
the root end of a sapling hacked into shape with sharp
stones), as if it had been a bulrush. In height and
bulk he was far above his fellows, though similar to
them in general type except for the matter of color,
which was dark almost to blackness. His jaws were
those of a beast, and his whole appearance was bestial
beyond that of any other in the whole hideous throng&ndash;&ndash;except
for his eyes. These, though small and deep-set,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
blazed with fierce intelligence, and swept his
audience with an air of assured mastery which made
plain why he was chief. He was talking rapidly, with
broad gestures, and in a barking, clicking speech which
sounded little more than half articulate. He was working
himself up into a rage; and the squatting listeners
wriggled apprehensively, while they applauded from
time to time with grunts and growls.</p>
<p>Near the end of the foremost rank of the semi-circle,
very close to the haranguing Chief, sat one who was
plainly of superior race to his companions. Something
in the harangue seemed to concern him particularly,
for he sprang to his feet and stood leaning on
his club&ndash;&ndash;which was longer and more symmetrically
fashioned than that of the chief. In color he was
manifestly white, for all that dirt and the weather could
do to disguise it. He was taller even than the great
Black Chief himself&ndash;&ndash;but shorter in the body, and
achieving his height through length and straightness of
leg. He had chest and shoulders of enormous power;
but, unlike the barrel-shaped Bow-legs he was comparatively
slim of waist and hips. He had less hair
on the body&ndash;&ndash;except on the chest and forearm&ndash;&ndash;than
his companions; but far more on the head, where it
stood out all around like an immense black-tawny mane.
His face, though heavy and lowering, <i>was</i> a face&ndash;&ndash;with
square, resolute jaws, a modelled mouth, a big, fully-bridged
nose, and a spacious forehead. His eyes were
blue, and now, deep under their shaggy brows, glared
upon the Chief with desperate defiance. Close behind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
his heels crouched a girl, obviously of his own race&ndash;&ndash;a
tall, strong, shapely figure of a woman, as could well
be seen, though her attitude was one of utter dejection,
her face sunk upon her knees, and half her body hidden
in the tangled torrent of her dull chestnut hair.</p>
<p>The tall alien, so dauntlessly eyeing the Chief, was
Mawg the renegade. Arrogant in his folly, he had
not realized that the Tree Men would hold him to account
for the calamity which he had brought upon
them. He had not realized that the girl A-ya, with
her straight limbs and her strong comeliness, might
stir the craving of others besides himself. Now, as he
listened to the fierce harangue of the Chief, as his alert
ears caught the mutterings behind and about him, he
saw the pit yawn suddenly at his feet. But though
a brute and a traitor, he was no coward. His veins began
to run hot, his sinews to stretch for the death
struggle which would presently be upon him.</p>
<p>As for the girl, unseeing, unhearing, her head bowed
between her naked knees, she cared nothing. She
loathed life, and all about her, equally. Her baby and
her lord, if they yet lived, were far away beyond the
mountains and the swamps, in the caverned hillside
behind the smoke of the fires. Her captor, Mawg,
she loathed above all; but she was here behind him
because he held her always within reach lest the filthy
women of the Bow-legs should tear her to pieces.</p>
<p>Suddenly, without looking around, Mawg spoke to
her, in their own tongue, which the Bow-legs could
not understand. &#8220;Be ready, girl. They are going to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
kill me now. The Black Chief wants you. But I
kill him and we run. They are all dirt. <i>Come!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>On the word, he sprang straight at the great Black
Chief, where he towered upon his rock. But the girl,
though she heard every syllable, never stirred.</p>
<p>The spring of Mawg was like a leopard&#8217;s; but the
Black Chief, though slow of foot, was not slow of
hand or wits. Though taken by surprise, he swung
up his club in time to partly parry Mawg&#8217;s lightning
stroke, which would otherwise have broken his bull
neck. As it was, the club was almost beaten from his
grasp. He dropped it with a snarl and leaped at his
assailant&#8217;s throat with clutching hands.</p>
<p>Had it been possible to fight it out man to man,
Mawg would have liked nothing better, though the
issue would have been a doubtful one. But he had
no mind to face the whole tribe, which was now surging
forward like a pack of wolves. He had no time to
repeat his blow fairly; but as he eluded the gigantic,
clutching fingers he got in a light glancing stroke with
the butt which laid open his adversary&#8217;s cheek and
closed one furious little eye. At the same instant he
whirled away lithely, sprang from the rock on the
further side, and ran off like a deer through the trees,
cursing the girl because she had not followed him.
About half the tribe went trailing after him, yelling
hoarsely, while the rest drew back and waited uneasily
to see what their Chief would do.</p>
<p>The Chief, clapping one hairy hand over his
wounded eye, glared after the fugitive with the other.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
But he knew the folly of trying to catch his fleet-footed
adversary, and after a moment he dismissed him from
his mind. With a grunt he stepped down from his
rock, and heedless of his wound, strode over to the
girl. Through all the tumult she had never lifted her
head from between her knees, or shown the least sign
of concern. The Chief seized her by the shoulder and
shook her roughly, ordering her to come with him.
She did not understand his language, but his meaning
was obvious. She looked up and stared straight into
his one open eye. In her own eyes shifted the dangerous,
lambent flame of a beast at bay, and for a moment
she was on the point of darting at his throat.</p>
<p>But not without reason was the Black Chief dictator
of the Bow-legs. Brutal and filthy though he was,
and hideous beyond description, and horrible with his
gashed face and the blood pouring down over his huge
and shaggy chest, he was all a man, and the mastery
in him checked her. She felt the hopelessness of fighting
her fate. The flame flickered out, leaving her eyes
dull and leaden. She rose listlessly, and followed her
new lord to the tree in which he had his dwelling of
woven branches.</p>
<p>At the foot of the tree the Black Chief stopped,
stood back, and signed the girl to ascend. A climber
as expert as himself, she clutched the rough trunk
with accustomed hands. Then she hesitated, and shut
her eyes. Should she obey, yielding to her fate?
Mawg, her late captor, she had hated with a murderous
hate; yet she had submitted to him, in a dim way biding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
her time for vengeance. He was of her own race; and
it was in her mind, her spirit&ndash;&ndash;though she herself could
not so analyze the emotion&ndash;&ndash;that she hated him. But
this new master was an alien, and of a lower, beastlier
type. Toward him she felt a sick bodily repulsion.
Behind her tight-shut lids the dark went red. She
stood rigid and quivering, stormed through by a
raging impulse to tear out either his throat or her
own. She was herself a more advanced product of
her own advanced race, and urged by impulses still
new and imperfectly applied to life. But the countless
centuries of submission were in her blood also; and
they whispered to her insidiously that she was lawful
prey. A huge hand fell significantly upon the back
of her neck. She jumped, gave a sobbing cry, and
sprang up into the tree. Who was she to challenge
doom for an idea, a hundred thousand years before her
time.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Some days&#8217; journey to the westward of the swampy
refuge of the Bow-legs, a tall hunter was making his
way warily through the forest. His color, his build,
and his swift grace of movement proclaimed him of the
same race as Mawg and the girl A-ya, acquitting him
easily of any kinship with the People of the Trees.
In height and weight he was much like Mawg, but
lighter in complexion, somewhat less hairy, and of a
frank, sagacious countenance. His eyes were of a
blue-gray, calm and piercing, yet with a look in them
as of one who broods on mysteries. He was obviously
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
much older than Mawg, his long, thick hair and short,
close-curling beard being liberally touched with gray.
He carried in one hand a peculiar long-handled club,
which he had fashioned by lashing, with strips of green
hide, a split and jagged flint-stone into the cleft head
of a stick. In the other hand he bore two long, slender
spears, their tips hardened and pointed in fire.</p>
<p>On the day, now many weeks back, when Gr&ocirc;m
set out from the Caves behind the Fire to seek for
A-ya in the far-off country of the Bow-legs, he had
carried also two hollow tubes of green bark, with
the seeds of fire, kept smouldering in a bed of punk,
hidden in the hearts of them. But the need of stopping
frequently to build a fire and renew the vitality of the
secret spark had soon exasperated his impatient spirit.
Intolerant of the hindrance, and confident in his own
strength and craft, he had thrown the fire-tubes away
and fallen back upon the weapons which had sufficed
him before his discovery and conquest of the Shining
One.</p>
<p>Engrossed in his purpose, thinking only of regaining
possession of the girl, the mother of his man-child,
he shunned all contest with the great beasts which
crossed his path, and fled without shame from those
which undertook to hunt him.</p>
<p>He would risk no doubtful battle. He satisfied
his hunger on wild honey, and the ripe fruits and tubers
with which the forest abounded at this season. At
night he made his nest, of hurriedly woven branches,
in the highest swaying of the tree-tops, where not even
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
the leopard, cunning climber though she was, could
come at him without giving timely warning. And so,
doggedly and swiftly making his way due east, he came
at length to the fringes of that vast region of swampy
meres and fruitful, rankly wooded islets which was occupied
by the Bow-legs.</p>
<p>Here he had need of all that wood-craft which had
so often enabled him to stalk even the wary antelope.
The light color of his skin being a betrayal, he rubbed
himself with clayey ooze till he was of the same hue
as the Bow-legs. Crawling through the undergrowth
at dusk as soundlessly as a snake, or swinging along
smoothly through the branches like a gray ape in the
first confusing glimmer of the dawn, he made short
incursions among the outlying colonies, but could find
no sign of the girl, or Mawg, in whose hands he
imagined her still to be. But working warily around
the outskirts of the tribe, to northward, he came at
last upon the stale but unmistakable trail of a flight
and a pursuit. This he followed up till the pursuit
came stragglingly to an end, and the trail of the fugitive
stood out alone and distinct. One clear footprint in
the wet earth revealed itself clearly as Mawg&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;for
there was no such thing as confounding that arched
and moulded imprint with those left by the apish men.
Feverishly the hunter cast about for another trail,
smaller and slimmer. Forward he searched for it, and
then back among the trampings of the pursuers. But
in vain. Clearly Mawg had been the sole fugitive.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m sat down in sudden despair. If Mawg, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
at least was no coward, had fled alone, then surely the
girl was dead. Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s club and his spears dropped
from his nerveless hands. His interest in life sank
into a sick indifference, a dull anguish which he did
not even try to understand. It was well for him that
no prowling beast came by in that moment of his unseeing
weakness. Then a new thought came to him,
and his despair flamed into rage. He leapt to his feet,
clutching at his shaggy beard. The girl had been
seized, without doubt, by the great Black Chief. The
thought of this defilement to his woman, the mother of
his man-child, drove him quite mad for the moment.
Snatching up his weapons, he roared with anguish, and
ran blindly forward along the trampled trail, ready to
hurl himself upon the whole loathsome tribe. A
gigantic leopard, crouching in a thicket of scarlet
poinsettia beside the trail, made as if to pounce upon
him as he went by&ndash;&ndash;but shrank back, instead, with
flattened ears, daunted by his fury.</p>
<p>But presently the madness burned itself out. As
sanity returned he checked his rush, glanced once more
watchfully about him, and at length stepped furtively
into the thick of the jungle. Now more than ever
was his coolest craft demanded, that A-ya might be
plucked from the monster&#8217;s arms.</p>
<p>Following up the plain clue of that tremendous
pursuit, Gr&ocirc;m worked his way deep into the Bow-legs&#8217;
country. With all his craft and his lynx-like stealth,
it was at times hair-raising work. Not only the
ground thickets, but the tree-tops as well, were swarming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
with his keen-eyed foes. He had to worm his way
between swamp-sodden roots, and sometimes lie moveless
as a stone for hours, enduring the stings of a
million insects. Sometimes, not daring to lift his head
to look about him, he had to trust to his ears and his
hound-like sense of smell for information as to what
was going on. And sometimes it was only his tireless
immobility that saved him from the stroke of a startled
adder or a questioning and indignant crotalus. After
long swaying, poised for the death-stroke, the serpent
would decide that the menacing thing before it was not
alive. It would slowly dissolve its tense coils, and glide
away; and Gr&ocirc;m would resume his shadowy progress.</p>
<p>Then, about sunrise (for the Bow-legs, like the birds,
were early risers) of the second day after the discovery
of Mawg&#8217;s footprints, the patient hunter&#8217;s eyes
fell upon A-ya. He had crept in to within a hundred
yards or so of the Council Rock, which was surrounded
by a horde of the Bow-legs. Crouching low as he was,
in a dense thicket, Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s view was limited; but he
could see, over the heads of the listening mob, the
Black Chief seated on the rock, his ragged club in his
hand. He was haranguing his warriors in rapid clicks
and gutturals, which conveyed no meaning to Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s
ear. The harangue came soon to an end. The Chief
stood up. The bestial crowd parted&ndash;&ndash;and through the
opening Gr&ocirc;m saw A-ya, crouched, with her hair over
her knees, at the Chief&#8217;s feet. Stepping down from
the rock, the Chief seized her by the wrist and dragged
her upright. She took her place at his heels, dejectedly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
like a whipped dog. Gr&ocirc;m, from within his
thicket, ground his teeth, and with difficulty held himself
in leash. Surrounded as A-ya was, at that
moment, by the hordes of her captors, any attempt at
her rescue would have been hopeless folly.</p>
<p>There was something going on among the bow-legged
mob which Gr&ocirc;m, from his hiding-place could
not at first make out. Then he saw that the Chief
was trying to instruct his powerful but clumsy followers
in the handling of the club and spear. Having
been taught by the white renegade, Mawg, the Chief
used his massive club with skill, but he was still clumsy
and absurdly inaccurate in throwing the spear. After
he had split the face of one of his followers by a misdirected
cast, he gave up the spear-throwing, turned to
the girl, and ordered her to teach this art of her people.
It was obvious that the mob had vast confidence in
her powers, as one of superior race, although a mere
woman, for they opened out at once on two sides to
leave room for the expected display. The heart of
the watcher in the thicket began to thump as he saw
a way clearing itself between his hiding-place and the
wild-haired woman he loved.</p>
<p>A-ya affected to misunderstand the Chief&#8217;s orders.
She took the spear, but stood holding it in stupid dejection.
The Chief threatened her angrily, but she
paid no attention. At this moment the whistling cry
of a plover sounded from the thicket. The girl
straightened herself and every muscle grew tense. The
melancholy cry came again. It was a strange place
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
for a plover to lurk in, that rank thicket of jungle;
but the Bow-legs took no notice of the incongruity.
Upon the girl, however, the effect of the cry was
magical. She gave no glance toward the thicket, but
suddenly, smilingly, she seemed to understand the
orders of the Chief. Poising the rude spear at the
height of her shoulder, she pointed to a huge, whitish
fungus which grew upon a tree-root some sixty or
seventy feet away. With a flexing of her whole lithe
body&ndash;&ndash;as Gr&ocirc;m had taught her&ndash;&ndash;she made her throw.
The white fungus was split in halves.</p>
<p>With a hoarse clamor of admiration, the mob surged
forward to examine the fragments. Even the Chief,
though disdaining to show the interest of his followers,
took a stride or two in the same direction. For a
second his back was turned. In that second, the
girl fled, light and swift as a deer, speeding toward the
thicket whence the cry of the plover had sounded. Her
long bushy hair streamed out behind her as she ran.</p>
<p>With a bellow of wrath, the Black Chief, the whole
mob at his heels, came pounding after her. The next
instant, out from the thicket leapt Gr&ocirc;m, a towering
figure, and stood with spear uplifted. Like a lion
at bay, he glanced swiftly this way and that, balancing
the chances of battle and escape, while he menaced the
foes immediately confronting him.</p>
<p>At this amazing apparition, the mob paused irresolute;
but the Black Chief came on like a mad buffalo.
Gr&ocirc;m hurled one of his two spears. He hurled it
with a loathing fury; but he was compelled to throw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
high, to clear A-ya&#8217;s head. The Chief saw it coming,
and cunningly flung himself forward on his face.
The weapon hurtled on viciously, and pierced the
squat body of one of the waverers a dozen paces behind.
At his yell of agony the mob woke up, and
came on again with guttural, barking cries. But already
Gr&ocirc;m and the girl, side by side, were fleeing
down an open glade to the left, toward a breadth of
still water which they saw gleaming through the trunks.
Gr&ocirc;m knew that the way behind him was swarming
with the enemy. He had seen that there was no
chance of getting through the hordes in front and to
the right. But in this direction there were only a
few knots of shaggy women, who shrank in terror at
his approach; and he gambled on the chance of the
bow-legged men having no great skill in the water.</p>
<p>All the Folk of the Caves could swim like otters,
and both Gr&ocirc;m and the girl were expert beyond their
fellows. The water before them was some three or
four hundred yards in width. They did not know
whether it was a sluggish fenland river, or the arm of
a lake; but, heedless of the peril of crocodiles and
water-snakes they plunged in, and with long powerful
side-strokes went surging across toward the opposite
shore. They had a clear start of thirty or forty yards,
and their pace in the water was tremendous. Some
heavy splashes in the water behind them showed how
the clumsy missiles of their foes&ndash;&ndash;ragged clubs and
fragments of broken branches&ndash;&ndash;were falling short; and
they looked back derisively.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>The bow-legged, shaggy men with their wide, red,
skyward nostrils were ranged along the shore, and the
Chief was fiercely urging them into the water. They
shrank back in horror at the prospect&ndash;&ndash;which, indeed,
seemed little to the taste of the Chief himself.
Presently he seized the two nearest by their matted
manes, and flung them headlong in. With yells of
terror they scrambled out again, and scurried off to the
rear like half-drowned hens.</p>
<p>The Chief screeched an order. Straightway the mob
divided. One part went racing clumsily up the shore
to the left, the other followed the Chief along through
the rank sedge-growth to the right&ndash;&ndash;the Chief, by
reason of his superior stature and length of leg, rapidly
opening up his lead.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing but a pond,&#8221; said Gr&ocirc;m, in disgust,
&#8220;and they&#8217;re coming round the shore to head us off.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the girl, her hair trailing darkly on the water
behind her, only laughed. She was free at last. And
she was with her man.</p>
<p>Suddenly Gr&ocirc;m felt a sharp, stabbing pain in the
calf of his leg. With a cry, he looked back, expecting
to see a water-snake gliding off. He saw nothing.
But in the next instant another stab came in the other
leg. Then A-ya screamed: &#8220;They&#8217;re biting me all
over.&#8221; A dozen stinging punctures distributed themselves
all at once over Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s body. Then he understood
that their assailants were not water-snakes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick! To shore!&#8221; he ordered. Throwing all
their strength into a breath-sapping, over-hand roll,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
they shot forward, gained the weedy shallows, and
scrambled ashore. Their bodies were hung thickly with
gigantic leeches.</p>
<p>Heedless of the wounds and the drench of blood,
they tore off their loathsome assailants. Then, after
a few seconds&#8217; halt to regain breath and decide on their
direction, they started northwestward at a rapid, swinging
lope, through a region of open, grassy glades set
with thickets of giant fern and mimosa.</p>
<p>They had run on at this free pace for a matter of
half-an-hour or more, and were beginning to flatter
themselves that they had shaken off their pursuers,
when almost directly ahead of them, to the right, appeared
the Black Chief, lumbering down upon them.
Nearly half-a-mile behind, between the mimosa clumps,
could be seen the mob of his followers straggling up
to his support. He yelled a furious challenge, swung
up his great club, and charged upon Gr&ocirc;m. Waving
A-ya behind him, Gr&ocirc;m strode forward, accepting the
challenge.</p>
<p>As man to man, the rivals looked not unfairly
matched. The fair-skinned Man of the Caves was the
taller by half a head, but obviously the lighter in
weight by a full stone, if not more. His long,
straight, powerfully muscled legs had not the massive
strength of his bow-legged adversary&#8217;s. He was even
slim, by comparison, in hip and waist. But in chest,
arms and shoulders his development was finer.
Physically, it seemed a matter of the lion against the
bear.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></p>
<p>To Gr&ocirc;m there was one thing almost as vital, in
that moment, as the rescue of his woman. This was
the slaking of his lust of hate against the filthy beast-man
who had held that woman captive. Fading
ancestral instincts flamed into new life within him.
His impulse was to fling down spear and club, to fall
upon his rival with bare, throttling hands and rending
teeth. But his will, and his realization of all that
hung upon the outcome, held this madness in check.</p>
<p>Silent and motionless, poised lightly and gathered as
if for a spring, Gr&ocirc;m waited till his adversary was
within some thirty paces of him. Then, with deadly
force and sure aim, he hurled his one remaining spear.
But he had not counted on the lightning accuracy,
swifter than thought itself, with which the men of the
trees used their huge hands. The Black Chief caught
the spear-head within a few inches of his body. With
a roar of rage he snapped the tough shaft like a
parsnip stalk, and threw the pieces aside. Even as
he did so, Gr&ocirc;m, still voiceless and noiseless, was upon
him.</p>
<p>Had the vicious swing of Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s flint-headed club
found its mark, the battle would have been over. But
the Black Chief, for all his bulk, was quick as an eel.
He bowed himself to the earth, so that the stroke
whistled idly over him, and in the next second he
swung a vicious, short blow upwards. It was well-aimed,
at the small of Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s back. But the latter,
feeling himself over-balanced by his own ineffective
violence, leapt far out of reach before turning to see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
what had happened. The Chief recovered himself,
and the two lashed out at each other so exactly together
that the great clubs met in mid-air. So shattering was
the force of the impact, so numbing the shock to the
hairy wrists behind it, that both weapons dropped to
the ground.</p>
<p>Neither antagonist dared stoop to snatch them up.
For several seconds they stood glaring at each other,
their breath hissing through clenched teeth, their
knotted fingers opening and shutting. Then they
sprang at each other&#8217;s throats&ndash;&ndash;Gr&ocirc;m in silence, the
Black Chief snarling hoarsely. Neither, however,
gained the fatal grip at which he aimed. They found
themselves in a fair clinch, and stood swaying, straining,
sweating, and grunting, so equally matched in
sheer strength that to A-ya, standing breathless with
suspense, the dreadful seconds seemed to drag themselves
out to hours. Then Gr&ocirc;m, amazed to find that
in brute force he had met his match, feigned to give
way. Loosing the clutch of one arm, he dropped upon
his knees. With a grunt of triumph the Black Chief
crashed down upon him, only to find himself clutched
by the legs and hurled clean over his wily adversary&#8217;s
head. Before he could recover himself, Gr&ocirc;m was
upon him, pinning him to the earth and reaching for
his throat. In desperation he set his huge ape teeth,
with the grip of a bull-dog, deep into the muscular base
of Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s neck, and began working his way in toward
the artery.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></p>
<p>At this moment A-ya glanced about her. She saw
two bodies of the Bow-legs closing in upon them from
either side&ndash;&ndash;the nearest not much more than a couple
of hundred yards distant. Her lord had plainly
ordered her to stand aside from this combat, but this
was no time for obedience. She snatched up the sharpened
fragment of the broken spear. Gripping it with
both hands she drove it with all her force into the
side of the Black Chief&#8217;s throat, and left it there.
With a hideous cough his grip relaxed. His limbs
straightened out stiffly, and he lay quivering.</p>
<p>Covered with blood, Gr&ocirc;m sprang to his feet, and
turned angrily upon A-ya. &#8220;<i>I</i> would have killed him,&#8221;
he said, coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no time,&#8221; answered the girl, and pointed
to the advancing hordes.</p>
<p>Without a word Gr&ocirc;m snatched up his club,
wrenched the broken spear from his dead rival&#8217;s neck,
thrust it into the girl&#8217;s hands, and darted for the
narrowing space of open between the two converging
mobs.</p>
<p>With their greatly superior speed it was obvious that
the two fugitives might reasonably expect to win
through. They were surprised, therefore, at the note
of triumph in the furious cries of the Bow-legs. A
few hundred yards ahead the comparatively open
country came to an end, and its place was taken by a
belt of splendid crimson bloom, extending to right and
left as far as the eye could see. It was a jungle of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
shrubs some twenty feet high, with scanty, pale-green
leaves almost hidden by their exuberance of blossom.
But jungle though it was, Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s sagacious eyes decided
that it was by no means dense enough to seriously
hinder their flight. When they reached it, the jabbering
hordes were almost upon them. But, with mocking
laughter, they slipped through, and plunged in
among the gray stems, beneath the overshadowed rosy
glow. Their pursuers yelled wildly&ndash;&ndash;it seemed to
Gr&ocirc;m a yell of exultation&ndash;&ndash;but they halted abruptly at
the edge of the rosy barrier and made no attempt to
follow.</p>
<p>&#8220;They know they can&#8217;t catch us,&#8221; said Gr&ocirc;m,
slackening his pace. But the girl, puzzled by this
sudden stopping of the pursuit, felt uneasy and made
no reply.</p>
<p>Loping onward at moderate pace through the enchanting
pink light, which filtered down about them
through the massed bloom overhead, they presently
became conscious of an oppressive silence. The cries
of their pursuers having died away behind them, there
was now nothing but the soft thud of their own footfalls
to relieve the anxious intentness of their ears.
Not a bird-note, not the flutter of a wing, not the hum
or the darting of a single insect, disturbed the strangely
heavy air. No snake or lizard or squeaking mouse
scurried among the fallen leaves. They wondered
greatly at such stillness. Then they wondered at the
absence of small undergrowth, the lack of other shrubs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
and trees such as were wont to grow together in the
warm jungle. Nothing anywhere about them but
the endless gray stems and pallid slim leaves of the
oleander, with their rose-red roof of blossom.</p>
<p>Presently they felt a lethargy creeping over their
limbs, which began to grow heavy; and a dull pain
came throbbing behind their eyes. Then understanding
of those cries of triumph flashed into Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s
mind. He stopped and clutched the girl by the wrist.
&#8220;It is poison here. It is death,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;That&#8217;s
why they shouted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, everything is dead but the red flowers,&#8221;
whispered A-ya, and clung to him, shuddering with
awe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Courage!&#8221; cried Gr&ocirc;m, lifting his head and dashing
his great hand across his eyes. &#8220;We <i>must</i> get
through. We <i>must</i> find air.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shaking off the deadly sloth, they ran on again
at full speed, peering through the stems in every direction.
The effort made their brains throb fiercely.
And still there was nothing before them and about
them but the endless succession of slender gray stems
and the downpour of that sinister rosy light. At last
A-ya&#8217;s steps began to lag, as if she were growing sleepy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wake up!&#8221; shouted Gr&ocirc;m, and dragged so fiercely
at her arm that she cried out. But the pain aroused
her to a new effort. She sprang forward, sobbing.
The next moment, she was jerked violently to the left.
&#8220;This way!&#8221; panted Gr&ocirc;m, the sweat pouring down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
his livid face; and there, through the stems to the left,
her dazed eyes perceived that the hated rosy glow was
paling into the whiteness of the natural day.</p>
<p>It was a big white rock, an island thrust up through
the sea of treacherous bloom. With fumbling, nerveless
fingers they scaled its bare sides, flung themselves
down among the scant but wholesome herbage,
which clothed its top, and filled their lungs with the
clean, reviving air. Dimly they heard a blessed buzzing
of insects, and several great flies, with barred
wings, lit upon them and bit them sharply. They lay
with closed eyes, while slowly the throbbing in their
brains died away and strength flowed back into their
unstrung limbs.</p>
<p>Then, after perhaps an hour, Gr&ocirc;m sat up and looked
about him. On every side outspread the fatal flood
of the rose-red oleanders, unbroken except toward
the north-west. In that quarter, however, a spur
of the giant forest, of growths too mighty to feel the
spell of the envenomed blooms, was thrust deep into
the crimson tide. Its tip came to within a couple of
hundred yards of the rock. Having fully recovered,
Gr&ocirc;m and A-ya swung down, with loathing, into the
pink gloom, fled through it almost without drawing
breath, and found themselves once more in the rank
green shadows of the jungle. They went on till they
came to a thicket of plantains. Then, loading themselves
with ripe fruit, they climbed high into a tree, and
wove themselves a safe resting-place among the
branches.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>For the next few days their journey was without
adventure, save for the frequent eluding of the
monsters of that teeming world. Gr&ocirc;m had his club,
A-ya her broken spear; but they were avoiding all
combats in their haste to get back to their own country
of the homely caves and the guardian watch-fires. At
the approach of the great black lion or the saber-tooth,
or the wantonly malignant rhinoceros, they betook
themselves to the tree-tops, and continued their way
by that a&euml;rial path as long as it served them. The
most subtle of the beasts they knew they could outwit,
and their own anxiety now was Mawg, whose craft
and courage Gr&ocirc;m could no longer hold in scorn. He
was doubtless at large, and quite possibly on their
trail, biding his time to catch them unawares. They
never allowed themselves, therefore, to sleep both at
the same time. One always kept on guard: and hence
their progress, for all their eagerness, was slower than
it would otherwise have been.</p>
<p>On a certain day, after a long unbroken stretch of
travel, A-ya rested and kept watch in a tree-top, while
Gr&ocirc;m went to fetch a bunch of plantains. It was
fairly open country, a region of low herbage dotted
with small groves and single trees; and the girl, herself
securely hidden, could see in every direction. She
could see Gr&ocirc;m wandering from plantain clump to
plantain clump, seeking fruit ripe enough to be palatable.
And then, with a shiver of hate and dread, she
saw the dark form of Mawg, creeping noiselessly on
Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s trail, and not more than a couple of hundred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
paces behind him. At the very moment when her
eyes fell upon him, he dropped flat upon his face, and
began worming his way soundlessly through the
herbage.</p>
<p>Her mouth opened wide to give the alarm. But the
cry stopped in her throat, and a smile of bitter triumph
spread over her face.</p>
<p>If Mawg was hunting Gr&ocirc;m, he was at the same
time himself being hunted. And by a dreadful hunter.</p>
<p>Out from behind a thicket of glowing mimosa appeared
a monstrous bird, some ten or twelve feet in
height, lifting its feet very high in a swift but noiseless
and curiously delicate stride. Its dark plumage
was more like long, stringy hair than feathers. Its
build was something like that of a gigantic cassowary,
but its thighs and long blue shanks were proportionately
more massive. Its neck was long, but immensely
muscular to support the enormous head, which was
larger than that of a horse, and armed with a huge,
hooked, rending, vulture&#8217;s beak. The apparent length
of this terrible head was increased by a pointed crest
of blood-red feathers, projecting straight back in a
line with the fore-part of the skull and the beak.</p>
<p>The crawling figure of Mawg was still a good
hundred paces from the unsuspecting Gr&ocirc;m, when the
great bird overtook it. A-ya, watching from her tree-top,
clutched a branch and held her breath. Mawg&#8217;s
ears caught a sound behind him, and he glanced around
sharply. With a scream, he bounded to his feet. But
it was too late. Before he could either strike or flee,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
he was beaten down again, with a smash of that pile-driving
beak. The bird planted one huge foot on its
victim&#8217;s loins, gripped his head in its beak, and neatly
snapped his neck. Then it fell greedily to its hideous
meal.</p>
<p>At Mawg&#8217;s scream of terror, Gr&ocirc;m had turned and
rushed to the rescue, swinging his club. But before
he had covered half the distance, he saw that the
monster had done its work; and he hesitated. He was
too late to help the victim. And he knew the mettle
of this ferocious bird, almost as much to be dreaded,
in single combat, as the saber-tooth itself. At his
approach, the bird had lifted its dripping beak, half
turned, and stood gripping the prey with one foot,
swaying its grim head slowly and eyeing him with
malevolent defiance. Still he hesitated, fingering his
club; for the insolence of that challenging stare made
his blood seethe. Then came A-ya&#8217;s voice from the
tree-top, calling him. &#8220;Come away!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;It
was Mawg.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whereupon he turned, with the content of one who
sees all old scores cleanly wiped out together, and went
back to gather his ripe plantains.</p>
<p>The peril of Mawg being thus removed from their
path, they journeyed more swiftly; and when the next
new moon was a thin white sickle in the sky, just above
the line of saw-toothed hills, they came safely back to
the comfortable caves and the clear-burning watch-fires
of their tribe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE BENDING OF THE BOW</h3>
</div>
<p>Before the Caves of the Pointed Hills the fires
of the tribe burned brightly. Within the caves
reigned plenty and an unheard-of security; for since
the conquest of fire those monstrous beasts and gigantic
carnivorous, running birds, which had been Man&#8217;s
ceaseless menace ever since he swung down out of the
tree-tops to walk the earth erect, had been held at a
distance through awe of the licking flames. Though
the great battle which had hurled back the invading
hosts of the Bow-legs had cost the tribe more than
half its warriors, the Caves were swarming with vigorous
children. To Bawr, the Chief, and to Gr&ocirc;m, his
Right Hand and Councilor, the future of the tribe
looked secure.</p>
<p>So sharp had been the lessons lately administered
to the prowling beasts&ndash;&ndash;the terrible saber-tooth, the
giant red bear of the caves, the proud black lion, and
the bone-crushing cave hyena&ndash;&ndash;that even the stretch
of bumpy plain outside the circle of the fires, to a
distance of several hundred paces, was considered a
safe playground for the children of the tribe. On the
outermost skirts of this playground, to be sure, just
where the reedy pools and the dense bamboo thickets
began, there was a fire kept burning. But this was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
more as a reminder than as an actual defense. When
a bear or a saber-tooth had once had a blazing brand
thrust in his face, he acquired a measure of discretion.
Moreover, the activities of the tribe had driven all
the game animals to some distance up the valley; and
it was seldom that anything more formidable than a
jackal or a civet-cat cared to come within a half-mile
of the fires.</p>
<p>It was now two years since the rescue of A-ya from
her captivity among the Bow-legs. Her child by Gr&ocirc;m
was a straight-limbed, fair-skinned lad of somewhere
between four and five years. She sat cross-legged near
the sentinel fire, some fifty yards or so from the edge
of the thickets, and played with the lad, whose eyes
were alight with eager intelligence. Behind her
sprawled, playing contentedly with its toes and sucking
a banana, a fat brown flat-nosed baby of some
fourteen or fifteen months.</p>
<p>Both A-ya and the boy were interested in a new
toy. It was, perhaps, the first whip. The boy had
succeeded in tying a thin strip of green hide, something
over three feet in length, to one end of a stick which
was several inches longer. The uses of a whip came
to him by unerring insight, and he began applying it
to his mother&#8217;s shoulders. The novelty of it delighted
them both. A-ya, moreover, chuckled slyly at the
thought that the procedure might, on some future occasion,
be reversed, not without advantage to the cause
of discipline.</p>
<p>At last the lithe lash, so enthusiastically wielded,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
stung too hard for even A-ya, with all her stoicism,
to find it amusing. She snatched the toy away and
began playing with it herself. The lash, at its free end,
chanced to be slit almost to the tip, forming a loop.
The butt of the handle was formed by a jagged knot,
where it had been broken from the parent stem. Idly
but firmly, with her strong hands she bent the stick,
and slipped the loop over the jagged knot, where it
held.</p>
<p>Interested, but with no hint of comprehension in
her bright eyes, she looked upon the first bow&ndash;&ndash;the
stupendous product of a child and a woman playing.</p>
<p>The child, displeased at this new, useless thing, and
wanting his whip back, tried to snatch the bow from
his mother&#8217;s hands. But she pushed him off. She
liked this new toy. It looked, somehow, as if it invited
her to do something with it. Presently she
pulled the cord, and let it go again. Tightly strung,
it made a pleasant little humming sound. This she
repeated many times, holding it up to her ear and
laughing with pleasure. The boy grew interested
thereupon, and wanted to try the new game for himself.
But A-ya was too absorbed. She would not
let him touch it. &#8220;Go get another stick,&#8221; she commanded
impatiently; but quite forgot to see her command
obeyed.</p>
<p>As she was twanging the strange implement which
had so happily fashioned itself under her hands, Gr&ocirc;m
came up behind her. He stepped carefully over the
sprawling brown baby. He was about to pull her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
heavy hair affectionately; but his eyes fell upon the
thing in her hands, and he checked himself.</p>
<p>For minute after minute he stood there motionless,
watching and studying the new toy. His eyes narrowed,
his brows drew themselves down broodingly.
The thing seemed to him to suggest dim, cloudy, vast
possibilities; and he groped in his brain for some hint
of the nature of these possibilities. Yet as far as he
could see it was good for nothing but to make a faintly
pleasant twang for the amusement of women and
children. At last he could keep his hands off it no
longer. &#8220;Give it to me,&#8221; said he suddenly, laying hold
of A-ya&#8217;s wrist.</p>
<p>But A-ya was not yet done with it. She held it
away from him, and twanged it with redoubled vigor.
Without further argument, and without violence,
Gr&ocirc;m reached out a long arm, and found the bow in
his grasp. A-ya was surprised that such a trifle should
seem of such importance in her lord&#8217;s eyes; but her
faith was great. She shook the wild mane of hair
back from her face, silenced the boy&#8217;s importunings
with an imperative gesture, and gathered herself with
her arms about both knees to watch what Gr&ocirc;m would
do with the plaything.</p>
<p>First he examined it minutely, and then he fastened
the thong more securely at either end. He twanged
it as A-ya had done. He bent it to its limit and
eased it slowly back again, studying the new force imprisoned
in the changing curve. At last he asked who
had made it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; answered A-ya, very proud of her achievement
now that she found it taken so seriously by
one being to whom her adventurous spirit really deferred.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, <i>I</i> did!&#8221; piped the boy, with an injured air.</p>
<p>The mother laughed indulgently. &#8220;Yes, he tied one
end, and beat me with it,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Then I took
it from him, and bent the stick and tied the other end.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very good!&#8221; said Gr&ocirc;m, nodding his approval
musingly. He squatted down a few feet away, and
began experimenting.</p>
<p>Picking up a small stone, he held it upon the cord,
bent the bow a little way, and let go. The stone flew
up and hit him with amazing energy in the mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Oh!</i>&#8221; murmured A-ya, sympathetically, as the
bright blood ran down his beard. But the child, thinking
that his father had done it on purpose, laughed with
hearty appreciation. Somewhat annoyed, Gr&ocirc;m got
up, moved a few paces farther away, and sat down
again with his back to the family circle.</p>
<p>As to the force that lurked in this slender little implement
he was now fully satisfied. But he was not
satisfied with the direction in which it exerted itself.
He continued his experiments, but was careful to
draw the bow lightly.</p>
<p>For a long time he found it impossible to guess
beforehand the direction which the pebbles, or the
bits of stick or bark, would take in their surprising
leaps from the loosed bow-string. But at length a
dim idea of aim occurred to him. He lifted the bow&ndash;&ndash;his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
left fist grasping its middle&ndash;&ndash;to the level of his
eyes, at arm&#8217;s length. He got the cord accurately in
the center of the pebble, and drew toward his nose.
This effort was so successful that the stone went
perfectly straight&ndash;&ndash;and caught him fair on the thumb-knuckle.</p>
<p>The blow was so sharp that he dropped the bow
with an angry exclamation. Glancing quickly over
his shoulder to see if A-ya had noticed the incident,
he observed that her face was buried between her
knees and quite hidden by her hair. But her shoulders
were heaving spasmodically. He suspected that she
was laughing at him; and for a moment, as his knuckle
was aching fiercely, he considered the advisability of
giving her a beating. He had never done such a
thing to her, however, though all the other Cave Men,
including Bawr himself, were wont to beat their women
on occasion. In his heart he hated the idea of hurting
her; and it would hardly be worth while to beat her
without hurting her. The idea, therefore, was
promptly dismissed. He eyed the shaking shoulders
gloomily for some seconds; and then, as the throbbing
in the outraged knuckle subsided, a grin of sympathetic
comprehension spread over his own face. He picked
up the bow, sprang to his feet, and strolled over to the
edge of a thicket of young cane.</p>
<p>The girl, lifting her head, peered at him cautiously
through her hair. Her laughter was forgotten on the
instant, because she guessed that his fertile brain was
on the trail of some new experiment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>Arriving at the cane-thicket, Gr&ocirc;m broke himself
half a dozen well-hardened, tapering stems, from two
to three feet in length, and about as thick at their
smaller ends as A-ya&#8217;s little finger.</p>
<p>These seemed to suggest to him the possibility of
better results than anything he could get from those
erratic pebbles.</p>
<p>By this time quite a number of curious spectators&ndash;&ndash;women
and children mostly, the majority of the
men being away hunting, and the rest too proud to
show their curiosity&ndash;&ndash;had gathered to watch Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s
experiments. They were puzzled to make out what
it was he was busying himself with. But as he was
a great chief, and held in deeper awe than even Bawr
himself, they did not presume to come very near; and
they had therefore not perceived, or at least they had
not apprehended, those two trifling mishaps of his.
As for Gr&ocirc;m, he paid his audience no attention whatever.
Now that he had possessed himself of those
slender straight shafts of cane, all else was forgotten.
He felt, as he looked at them and poised them, that
in some vital way they belonged to this fascinating
implement which A-ya had invented for him.</p>
<p>Selecting one of the shafts, he slowly applied the
bigger end of it to the bow-string, and stood for a
long time pondering it, drawing it a little way and
easing it back without releasing it. Then he called to
mind that his spears always threw better when they
were hurled heavy end first. So he turned the little
shaft and applied the small end to the bow-string.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
Then he pulled the string tentatively, and let it go.
The arrow, all unguided, shot straight up into the air,
turned over, fell sharply, and buried its head in a
bit of soft ground. Gr&ocirc;m felt that this was progress.
The spectators opened their mouths in wonder, but
durst not venture any comment when Gr&ocirc;m was at his
mysteries.</p>
<p>Plucking the shaft from the earth, Gr&ocirc;m once more
laid it to the bow-string. As he pulled the string, the
shaft wobbled crazily. With a growl of impatience,
he clapped the fore-finger of his left hand over it, holding
it in place, and pulled it through the guide thus
formed. A light flashed upon his brooding intelligence.
Slightly crooking his finger, so that the shaft
could move freely, he drew the string backward and
forward, with deep deliberation, over and over again.
To his delight, he found that the shaft was no longer
eccentrically rebellious, but as docile as he could wish.
At last, lifting the bow above his head, he drew it
strongly, and shot the shaft into the air. He shouted
as it slipped smoothly through the guiding crook of
his finger and went soaring skyward as if it would
never stop. The eyes of the spectators followed its
flight with awe, and A-ya, suddenly comprehending,
caught her breath and snatched the boy to her heart in
a transport. Her alert mind had grasped, though
dimly, the wonder of her man&#8217;s achievement.</p>
<p>Now, though Gr&ocirc;m had pointed his shaft skyward,
he had taken no thought whatever as to its direction,
or the distance it might travel. As a matter of fact,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
he had shot towards the Caves. He had shot strongly;
and that first bow was a stiff one. Most of the folk
who squatted before the Caves were watching; but
there were some who were too indifferent or too stupid
to take an interest in anything less arresting than a
thump on the head. Among these was a fat old
woman, who, with her back to all the excitement, was
bending herself double to grub in the litter of sticks
and bones for some tit-bit which she had dropped.
Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s shaft, turning gracefully against the blue
came darting downward on a long slope, and buried
its point in that upturned fat and grimy thigh. With
a yell the old woman whipped round, tore out the
shaft, dashed it upon the ground, stared at it in horror
as if she thought it some kind of snake, and waddled,
wildly jabbering, into the nearest cave.</p>
<p>An outburst of startled cries arose from all the
spectators, but it hushed itself almost in the same
breath. It was Gr&ocirc;m who had done this singular
thing, smiting unawares from very far off. The old
woman must have done something to make Gr&ocirc;m
angry. They were all afraid; and several, whose
consciences were not quite at ease, followed the old
woman&#8217;s example and slipped into the Caves.</p>
<p>As for Gr&ocirc;m, his feelings were a mixture of embarrassment
and elation. He was sorry to have hurt
the old woman. He had a ridiculous dislike of hurting
any one unnecessarily; and when he looked back and
saw A-ya rocking herself to and fro in heartless mirth,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
he felt like asking her how she would have liked it
herself, if she had been in the place of the fat old
woman. On the other hand, he knew that he had
made a great discovery, second only to the conquest
of the fire. He had found a new weapon, of unheard-of,
unimagined powers, able to kill swiftly and
silently and at a great distance. All he had to do was
to perfect the weapon and learn to control it.</p>
<p>He strode haughtily up to the cave mouth to recover
his shaft. The people, even the mightiest of the
warriors, looked anxious and deprecating at his approach;
but he gave them never a glance. It would
not have done to let them think he had wounded the
old woman by accident. He picked up the shaft and
examined its bloodstained point, frowning fiercely.
Then he glared into the cave where the unlucky victim
of his experiments had taken refuge. He refitted the
shaft to the bow-string, and made as if to follow up
his stroke with further chastisement. Instantly there
came from the dark interior a chorus of shrill feminine
entreaties. He hesitated, seemed to relent, put the
shaft into the bundle under his arm, and strode back
to rejoin A-ya. He had done enough for the moment.
His next step required deep thought and preparation.</p>
<p>An hour or two later, Gr&ocirc;m set out from the Caves
alone in spite of A-ya&#8217;s pleadings. He wanted
complete solitude with his new weapon. Besides a
generous bundle of canes, of varying lengths and sizes,
he carried some strips of raw meat, a bunch of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
plantains, his spear and club, and a sort of rude basket,
without handle, formed by tying together the ends of
a roll of green bark.</p>
<p>This basket was a device of A-ya&#8217;s, which had added
greatly to her prestige in the tribe, and caused the
women to regard her with redoubled jealousy. By
lining it thickly with wet clay, she was able to carry
fire in it so securely and simply that Gr&ocirc;m had adopted
it at once, throwing away his uncertain and always
troublesome fire-tubes of hollow bamboo.</p>
<p>Mounting the steep hillside behind the Caves, Gr&ocirc;m
turned into a high, winding ravine, and was soon lost
to the sight of the tribe. The ravine, the bed of a
long-dry torrent, climbed rapidly, bearing around to
the eastward, and brought him at length to a high
plateau on a shoulder of the mountain. At the back
of the plateau the mountain rose again, abruptly, to one
of those saw-tooth pinnacles which characterized this
range. At the base of the steep was a narrow fissure
in the rock-face, leading into a small grotto which
Gr&ocirc;m had discovered on one of his hunting expeditions.
He had used it several times already as a retreat
when tired of the hubbub of the tribe and anxious
to ponder in quiet some of the problems which for ever
tormented his fruitful brain.</p>
<p>Absorbed in meditations upon his new weapons,
Gr&ocirc;m set himself to build a small fire before the entrance
of the grotto. The red coals from his fire-basket
he surrounded and covered with dry grass, dead
twigs, and small sticks. Then, getting down upon all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
fours, he blew long and steadily into the mass till
the smoke which curled up from it was streaked with
thin flames. As the flames curled higher, his ears
caught the sound of something stirring within the cave.
He looked up, peering between the little coils of smoke,
and saw a pair of eyes, very close to the ground, glaring
forth at him from the darkness.</p>
<p>With one hand, he coolly but swiftly fed the fire
to fuller volume, while with the other he reached for
and clutched his club. The eyes drew back slowly to
the depths of the cave. Appearing not to have observed
them, Gr&ocirc;m piled the fire with heavier and
heavier fuel, till it was blazing strongly and full of
well-lighted brands. Then he stood up, seized a brand,
and hurled it into the cave. There was a harsh snarl,
and the eyes disappeared, the owner of them having apparently
shrunk off to one side.</p>
<p>A moment or two later the interior was suddenly
lighted up with a smoky glare. The brand had fallen
on a heap of withered grass which had formerly been
Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s couch. Gr&ocirc;m set his teeth and swung up his
club; and in the same instant there shot forth two
immense cave-hyenas, mad with rage and terror.</p>
<p>The great beasts were more afraid of the sudden
flare within than of the substantial and dangerous fire
without. The first swerved just in time to escape the
fire, and went by so swiftly that the stroke of Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s
club caught him only a light, glancing blow on the
rump. But the second of the pair, the female, was
too close behind to swerve in time. She dashed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
straight through the fire, struck Gr&ocirc;m with all her
frantic weight, knocked him flat, and tore off howling
down the valley, leaving a pungent trail of singed
fur on the air.</p>
<p>Uninjured save for an ugly scratch, which bled
profusely, down one side of his face, Gr&ocirc;m picked
himself up in a rage and started after the fleeing
beasts. But his common sense speedily reasserted
itself. He grunted in disgust, turned back to the fire,
and was soon absorbed in new experiments with the
bow. As for the blaze within the cave, he troubled
himself no more about it. He knew it would soon
burn out. And it would leave the cave well cleansed
of pestilential insects.</p>
<p>All that afternoon he experimented with his bundle
of shafts, to find what length and what weight would
give the best results. One of the arrows he shattered
completely, by driving it, at short range, straight
against the rock-face of the mountain. Two others
he lost, by shooting them, far beyond his expectations,
over the edge of the plateau and down into the dense
thickets below him, where he did not care to search too
closely by reason of the peril of snakes. The bow, as
his good luck would have it, though short and clumsy
was very strong, being made of a stick of dry upland
hickory. And the cord of raw hide was well-seasoned,
stout and tough; though it had a troublesome trick
of stretching, which forced Gr&ocirc;m to restring it many
times before all the stretch was out of it.</p>
<p>Having satisfied himself as to the power of his bow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
and the range of his arrows, Gr&ocirc;m set himself next
to the problem of marksmanship. Selecting a plant
of prickly pear, of about the dimensions of a man,
he shot at it, at different ranges, till most of its great
fleshy leaves were shredded and shattered. With his
straight eye and his natural aptitude, he soon grasped
the idea of elevation for range, and made some respectable
shooting. He also found that he could guide
the arrow without crooking his finger around it. His
elation was so extreme that he quite forgot to eat, till
the closing in of darkness put an end to his practice.
Then, piling high his fire as a warning to prowlers,
he squatted in the mouth of the cave and made his
meal. For water he had to go some little way below
the lip of the plateau; but carrying a blazing balsam-knot
he had nothing to fear from the beasts that lay
in ambush about the spring. They slunk away sullenly
at the approach of the waving flame.</p>
<p>That night Gr&ocirc;m slept securely, with three fires
before his door. Every hour or two, vigilant woodsman
that he was, he would wake up to replenish the
fires, and be asleep again even in the act of lying down.
And when the dawn came red and amber around the
shoulder of the saw-toothed peak, he was up again and
out into the chill, sweet air with his arrows.</p>
<p>The difficulty which now confronted him was that
of giving his shafts a penetrating point. Being of
a very hard-fibered cane, akin to bamboo, they would
take a kind of splintering-point of almost needle sharpness.
But it was fragile; and the cane being hollow,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
the point was necessarily on one side, which affected
the accuracy of the flight. There were no flints in the
neighborhood, or slaty rocks, which he could split into
edged and pointed fragments. He tried hardening
his points in the fire; but the results were not altogether
satisfactory. He thought of tipping some of the
shafts with thorns, or with the steely points of the
old aloe leaves; but he could not, at the moment, devise
such a method of fixing these formidable weapons in
place as would not quite destroy their efficiency.
Finally he made up his mind that the thing to use
would be bone, ground into a suitable shape between
two stones. But this was a matter that would have
to await his return to the Caves, and would then call
for much careful devising. For the present he would
perforce content himself with such points as he had
fined down and hardened in the fire.</p>
<p>This matter settled in his mind, Gr&ocirc;m burned to
put his wonderful new weapon to practical test. He
descended cautiously the steep slope from the eastern
edge of his plateau&ndash;&ndash;a broken region of ledges, subtropical
thickets, and narrow, grassy glades, with here
and there some tree of larger growth rising solitary
like a watch-tower. Knowing this was a favorite feeding-hour
for many of the grass-eaters, he hid himself
in the well-screened crotch of a deodar, overlooking a
green glade, and waited.</p>
<p>He had not long to wait, for the region swarmed
with game. Out from a runway some thirty or forty
yards up the glade stepped a huge, dun-colored bull,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
with horns like scimitars each as long as Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s arm.
His flanks were scarred with long wounds but lately
healed, and Gr&ocirc;m realized that he was a solitary, beaten
and driven out from his herd by some mightier rival.
The bull glanced warily about him, and then fell to
cropping the grass.</p>
<p>The beast offered an admirable target. Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s
arrow sped noiselessly between the curtaining branches,
and found its mark high on the bull&#8217;s fore-shoulder.
It penetrated&ndash;&ndash;but not to a depth of more than two
or three inches. And Gr&ocirc;m, though elated by his
good shot, realized that such a wound would be nothing
more than an irritant.</p>
<p>Startled and infuriated, the bull roared and pawed
the sod, and glared about him to locate his unseen
assailant. He had not the remotest idea of the direction
from which the strange attack had come. The
galling smart in his shoulder grew momentarily more
severe. He lashed back at it savagely with the side
of his horn, but the arrow was just out of his reach.
Then, bewildered and alarmed, he tried to escape from
this new kind of fly with the intolerable sting by
galloping furiously up and down the glade. As he
passed the deodar, Gr&ocirc;m let drive another arrow, at
close range. This, too, struck, and stuck. But it did
not go deep enough to produce any serious effect.
The animal roared again, stared about him as if he
thought the place was bewitched, and plunged headlong
into the nearest thicket, tearing out both arrows
as he went through the close-set stems. Gr&ocirc;m heard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
him crashing onward down the slope, and smiled to
think of the surprise in store for any antagonist that
might cross the mad brute&#8217;s path.</p>
<p>This experiment upon the wild bull had shown Gr&ocirc;m
one thing clearly. He must arm his arrows with a
more penetrating point. Until he could carry out his
idea of giving them tips of bones, he must find some
shoots of solid, pithless growth to take the place of his
light hollow canes. For the next hour or two he
searched the jungle carefully and warily, looking for
a young growth that might immediately serve his
purpose.</p>
<p>But there in the jungle everything that was hard
enough was crooked or gnarled, everything that was
straight enough was soft and sappy. It was not till
the sun was almost over his head, and the heat was
urging him back to the coolness of his grotto, that he
came across something worth making a trial of. On a
bleak wind-swept knoll, far out on the mountain-side,
lay the trunk of an old hickory-tree, which had
evidently been shattered by lightning. From the
roots, tenacious of life, had sprung up a throng of
saplings, ranging from a foot or two in height to
the level of Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s head. They were as straight and
slim as the canes. And their hardness was proved
to Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s satisfaction when he tried to break them off.
They were tough, too, so that he almost lost his
patience over them, before he learned that the best way
to deal with them was to strip them down, in the
direction of the fiber, where they sprang from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
parent trunk or root. Having at length gathered an
armful, he returned to his grotto and proceeded to
shape the refractory butts in the fire. As he squatted
between the cave door and the fire he made his meal
of raw flesh and plantains, and gazed out contemplatively
over the vast, rankly-green landscape below him,
musing upon the savage and monstrous strife which
went on beneath that mask of wide-flung calm. And
as he pondered, the fire which he had subjugated was
quietly doing his work for him.</p>
<p>The result was beyond his utmost expectations.
After judicious charring, the ends being turned continually
in the glowing coals, he rubbed away the
charred portions between two stones, and found that
he could thus work up an evenly-rounded point. The
point thus obtained was keen and hard; and as he
balanced this new shaft in his hand he realized that its
weight would add vastly to its power of penetration.
When he tried a shot with it, he found that it flew
farther and straighter. It drove through the tough,
fleshy leaf of the prickly pear as if it hardly noticed the
obstruction. He fashioned himself a half-dozen more
of these highly-efficient shafts, and then set out again&ndash;&ndash;this
time down the ravine&ndash;&ndash;to seek a living target
for his practice.</p>
<p>The ravine was winding and of irregular width,
terraced here and there with broken ledges, here and
there cut into by steep little narrow gullies. Its bottom
was in part bare rock; but wherever there was an accumulation
of soil, and some tiny spring oozing up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
through the fissures, there the vegetation grew rank,
starred with vivid blooms of canna and hibiscus. In
many places the ledges were draped with a dense
curtain of the flat-flowered, pink-and-gold mesembryanthemum.
It was a region well adapted to the
ambuscading beasts; and Gr&ocirc;m moved stealthily as a
panther, keeping for the most part along the upper
ledges, crouching low to cross the open spots, and slipping
into cover every few minutes to listen and peer
and sniff.</p>
<p>Presently he came to a spot which seemed to offer
him every advantage as a place of ambush. It was
a ledge some twenty feet above the valley level, with
a sort of natural parapet behind which he could crouch,
and, unseen, keep an eye on all the glades and runways
below. Behind him the rock-face was so nearly perpendicular
that no enemy could steal upon him from the
rear. He laid his club and his spear down beside him,
selected one of his best arrows, and hoped that a fat
buck would come by, or one of those little, spotted, two-toed
horses whose flesh was so prized by the people of
the Caves. Such a prize would be a proof to all the
tribe of the potency of his new weapon.</p>
<p>For nearly an hour he waited, moveless, save for
his ranging eyes, as the rock on which he leaned. To
a hunter like Gr&ocirc;m, schooled to infinite patience, this
was nothing. He knew that, in the woods, if one
waits long enough and keeps still enough, he is bound
to see something interesting. At last it came. It was
neither the fat buck nor the little two-toed horse with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
dapple hide, but a young cow-buffalo. Gr&ocirc;m noticed
at once that she was nervous and puzzled. She seemed
to suspect that she was being followed and was undecided
what to do. Once she faced about angrily, staring
into the coverts behind her, and made as if to
charge. Had she been an old cow, or a bull, she would
have charged; but her inexperience made her irresolute.
She snorted, faced about again, and moved on, ears,
eyes and wide nostrils one note of wrathful interrogation.
She was well within range, and Gr&ocirc;m would
have tried a shot at her except for his seasoned wariness.
He would rather see, before revealing himself,
what foe it was that dared to trail so dangerous a
quarry. The buffalo moved on slowly out of range,
and vanished down a runway; and immediately afterwards
the stealthy pursuer came in view.</p>
<p>To Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s amazement, it was neither a lion nor a
bear. It was a man, of his own tribe. And then he
saw it was none other than the great chief, Bawr himself,
hunting alone after his haughty and daring
fashion. Between Gr&ocirc;m and Bawr there was the fullest
understanding, and Gr&ocirc;m would have whistled that
plover-cry, his private signal, but for the risk of interfering
with Bawr&#8217;s chase. Once more, therefore, he
held himself in check; while Bawr, his eyes easily
reading the trail, crept on with the soundless step of a
wild cat.</p>
<p>But Gr&ocirc;m was not the only hunter lying in ambush
in the sun-drenched ravine. Out from a bed of giant,
red-blooming canna arose the diabolical, grinning head
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
and monstrous shoulders of a saber-tooth, and stared
after Bawr. Then the whole body emerged with a
noiseless bound. For a second the gigantic beast
stood there, with one paw uplifted, its golden-tawny
bulk seeming to quiver in the downpour of intense sunlight.
It was a third as tall again at the shoulders as
the biggest Himalayan tiger, its head was flat-skulled
like a tiger&#8217;s, and its upper jaw was armed with two
long, yellow, saber-like tusks, projecting downwards
below the lower jaw. This appalling monster started
after Bawr with a swift, crouching rush, as silent, for
all its weight, as if its feet were shod with thistledown.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m leapt to his feet with a wild yell of warning,
at the same time letting fly an arrow. In his haste
the shaft went wide. Bawr, looking over his shoulder,
saw the giant beast almost upon him. With a tremendous
bound he gained the foot of a tree. Dropping
his club and spear, he sprang desperately, caught
a branch, and swung himself upward.</p>
<p>But the saber-tooth was already at his heels, before
he had time to swing quite out of reach. The gigantic
brute gathered itself for a spring which would have
enabled it to pluck Bawr from his refuge like a ripe
fig. But that spring was never delivered. With a
roar of rage the monster turned instead, and bit furiously
at the shaft of an arrow sticking in its flank.
Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s second shaft had flown true; and Bawr, greatly
marveling, drew up his legs to a place of safety.</p>
<p>With the fire of that deep wound in its entrails the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
saber-tooth forgot all about its quarry in the tree.
It had caught sight of Gr&ocirc;m when he uttered his yell
of warning, and it knew instantly whence the strange
attack had come. It bit off the protruding shaft;
and then, fixing its dreadful eyes on Gr&ocirc;m, it ceased
its snarling and came charging for the ledge with a
rush which seemed likely to carry it clear up the twenty-foot
perpendicular of smooth rock.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m, enamored of the new weapon, forgot the
spear which was likely to be far more efficient at
these close quarters. Leaning far out over the parapet,
he drew his arrow to the head and let drive just as the
monster reared itself, open-jawed, at the wall. The
pointed hickory went down into the gaping gullet, and
stood out some inches at the side of the neck. With a
horrible coughing screech the monster recoiled, put its
head between its paws, and tried to claw the anguish
from its throat. But after a moment, seeming to
realize that this was impossible, it backed away,
gathered itself together, and sprang for the ledge.
It received another of Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s shafts deep in the chest,
without seeming to notice the wound; and its impetus
was so tremendous that it succeeded in getting its
fore-paws fixed upon the ledge. Clinging there, its
enormous pale-green eyes staring straight into Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s,
it struggled to draw itself up all the way&ndash;&ndash;an effort
in which it would doubtless have succeeded at once
but for that first arrow in its entrails. The iron claws
of its hinder feet rasped noisily on the rock-face.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m dropped his bow beside him and reached for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
the spear. His hand grasped the club instead; but
there was no time to change. Swinging the stone-head
weapon in air, he brought it down, with a grunt of
huge effort, full upon one of those giant paws which
clutched the edge of the parapet. Crushed and
numbed, the grip of that paw fell away; but at the
same moment one of the hinder paws got over the
edge, and clung. And there the monster hung, its
body bent in a contorted bow.</p>
<p>Bawr, meanwhile, seeing Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s peril, had dropped
from his tree, snatched up his spear and club, and
rushed in to the rescue. It was courage, this, of
the finest, counting no odds; for down there on the
level he would have stood no ghost of a chance had
the beast turned back upon him. Gr&ocirc;m yelled to him
to keep away, and swung up his club for another
shattering blow. But in that same moment the great
glaring eyes filmed and rolled upwards; blood spouted
from between the gaping jaws; and with a spluttering
cough the monster lost its hold. It fell, with a soft
but jarring thud, upon its back, and slowly rolled
over upon its side, pawing the air aimlessly. The
arrow in the throat had done its work.</p>
<p>With fine self-restraint Bawr refrained from striking,
that he might seem to usurp no share in Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s
amazing achievement. He stood leaning upon his
spear, calmly watching the last feeble paroxysm, till
Gr&ocirc;m came scrambling down from the ledge and stood
beside him. He took the bow and arrows, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
examined them in silence. Then he turned upon
Gr&ocirc;m with burning eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You found the Fire for our people. You saved
our people from the hordes of the Bow-legs. You
have saved my life now, slaying the monster from
very far off with these little sticks which you have
made. It is you who should be Chief, not I.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m laughed and shook his head. &#8220;Bawr is the
better man of us two,&#8221; said he positively, &#8220;and he is
a better chief. He governs the people, while I go
away and think new things. And he is my friend.
Look, I will teach him now this new thing. And we
will make another just like it, that when we return
to the Caves Bawr also shall know how to strike from
very far off.&#8221;</p>
<p>With their rough-edged spear-heads of flint they
set themselves to the skinning of the saber-tooth.
Then they went back to the high plateau, where Bawr
was taught to shoot a straight shaft. And on the
following day they returned to the fires of the tribe,
carrying between them, shoulder high, slung upon their
two spears, this first trophy of the bow, the monstrous
head and hide of the saber-tooth.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>THE DESTROYING SPLENDOR</h3>
</div>
<p style='text-align:center;'>I</p>
<p>To Gr&ocirc;m, hunting farther to the south of the
Tribal Fires than he had ever ranged before,
came suddenly a woman running, mad with fright, a
baby clutched to her bosom. She fell at Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s feet,
gibbering breathlessly, and plainly imploring his protection.
Both she and the child were streaming with
blood, and covered with strange cup-like wounds,
as if the flesh had been gouged out of them with some
irresistible circular instrument.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m swiftly fitted an arrow to his bow, and peered
through the trees to see what manner of adversary the
fugitive was like to bring upon him. At the same
time, he gave a piercing cry, which was answered at
once from some distance behind him.</p>
<p>Having satisfied himself (the country being fairly
open) that the woman&#8217;s pursuer, whatever it might
be, was not close upon her heels, and that no immediate
danger was in view, he turned his attention upon the
woman herself. She was not of his race, and he
looked down upon her with cold aversion. At first
glance he thought she was one of the Bow-legs. But
the color of her skin, where it could be seen for the
blood, was different, being rather of a copper-red; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
she was neither so hairy on the body nor of so ape-like
proportions. She was sufficiently hideous, however,
and of some race plainly inferior to the People of
the Caves. The natural instinct of a Cave Man would
have been to knock her and her offspring on the head
without ceremony&ndash;&ndash;an effective method of guarding
his more highly developed breed from the mixture of
an inferior blood. But Gr&ocirc;m, the Chief and the wise
man, had many vague impulses moving him at times
which were novel to the human play-fellows of Earth&#8217;s
childhood. He disliked hurting a woman or a child.
He might, quite conceivably, have refused to concern
himself with the suppliant before him, and merely left
her and her baby to the chances of the jungle. But the
peculiar character of her wounds interested him. She
aroused his curiosity. Here was a new mystery for
him to investigate. The woman was saved.</p>
<p>Knowing a few words of the Bow-legs&#8217; tongue,
which he had learned from his lame slave Ook-ootsk,
he addressed the crouching woman, telling her not to
fear. The tongue was unintelligible to her, but the
tones of his voice seemed to reassure her. She sat
up, revealing again the form of the little one, which
she had been shielding with her hair and her bosom
as if she feared the tall white hunter might dash its
brains out; and Gr&ocirc;m noted with keen interest that
the child also had one of those terrible, cup-shaped
wounds, almost obliterating its fat, copper-colored
shoulder. He saw, also, that the woman&#8217;s face, though
uncomely, was more intelligent and human than the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
bestial faces of the Bow-legs&#8217; women. It was a broad
face, with very small, deep-set eyes, high cheek bones,
a tiny nose, and a very wide mouth, and it looked as
if some one had sat on it hard and pushed it in. The
idea made him smile, and the smile completed the
woman&#8217;s reassurance. She poured a stream of chatter
quite unlike the clicks and barkings of the Bow-legs.
Then she crept closer to Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s feet, and proceeded to
give her little one the breast. It was twisting uneasily
with the pain of its dreadful wound, but it nursed
hungrily, and with the prudent stoicism of a wild
creature it made no outcry.</p>
<p>As Gr&ocirc;m stood studying the pair, the mother kept
throwing glances of horror over her shoulder, as if
expecting her assailants to arrive at any moment.
Gr&ocirc;m followed her eyes, but there was no sign of any
pursuit. Then he observed the fugitives&#8217; wounds more
closely, and noted that the blood upon them was already,
in most cases, pretty well coagulated. He noted
also certain other wounds, deep, narrow punctures, like
stabs. He guessed that they could not be much less
than an hour old. The Thing, whatever it was, which
had inflicted them&ndash;&ndash;the Thing with so strange a mouth,
and so strange a way of using it&ndash;&ndash;had apparently
given up the pursuit. Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s curiosity burned within
him, and he was angry at the woman because she
could not speak to him in his own language, or at least
in that of the Bow-legs. It seemed to him willful
obstinacy on her part to refuse to understand the
Bow-legs&#8217; tongue. He stooped over her, and roughly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
examined one of the wounds with his huge fingers.
She winced, but made no complaint, only covering her
baby with her hair and her arms in terror lest it
should suffer a like harsh handling.</p>
<p>With a qualm of compunction, which rather puzzled
him, Gr&ocirc;m gave over his investigating, and turned to a
tall, slim youth with a great mop of chestnut hair who
at this moment came running up to him. It was
A-ya&#8217;s young brother, M&ocirc;, Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s favorite follower
and hunting mate; and he had come at speed, being
very swift of foot, in answer to Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s signal.
Breathing quickly, he stood at Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s side, and looked
down with wonder and dislike upon the crouching
woman.</p>
<p>Briefly Gr&ocirc;m explained, and then pointed to the
inexplicable wounds. The youth, unable to believe
that any human creature should be unable to comprehend
plain human speech, such as that of the Cave
People, tried his own hand at questioning the woman.
He got a flow of chatter in reply, but, being able to
make nothing out of it, he imagined it was not speech
at all, and turned away angrily, thinking that she
mocked him. Gr&ocirc;m, smiling at the mistake, explained
that the woman was talking her own language, which
he intended presently to learn as he had learned that
of the Bow-legs.</p>
<p>&#8220;But now,&#8221; said he, &#8220;we will go and see what it is
that has bitten the woman. It is surely something with
a strange mouth.&#8221;</p>
<p>M&ocirc;, who was not only brave to recklessness, but who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
would have followed Gr&ocirc;m through the mouth of hell,
sprang forward eagerly. Gr&ocirc;m, who realized that the
mystery before him was a perilous one, and who loved
to do dangerous things in a prudent manner, looked to
his bow-string and saw that his arrows were handy
in his girdle, before he started on the venture. Besides
his bow he carried the usual two spears and his inseparable
stone-headed club. Though danger was his
delight, it was not the danger itself but the thrill of
overcoming it that he loved.</p>
<p>The moment he stepped forward, however, the
woman divined his purpose and leapt wildly to her
feet. She sprang straight in front of him, screaming
and gesticulating. She was plainly horror-stricken
at the thought that the two men should venture into
the perils from which she had so hardly escaped. To
Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s keen intelligence her gestures were eloquent.
She managed to convey to him the idea of great
numbers, and the impossibility of his dealing with
them. When he attempted to pass her, she threw herself
down and clung to his feet, shaking with her
terror. When she saw that Gr&ocirc;m was at last impressed,
she stretched herself out as if dead, and then,
after a few moments of ghastly rigidity, with fixed,
staring eyes, she came to and held up one hand with
the fingers outspread.</p>
<p>This frantic pantomime Gr&ocirc;m could read in no other
way than as an attempt to tell him that the unknown
Something had killed five of the woman&#8217;s companions.
The information gave him pause. Adventurous as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
he was, he had small respect for mere pig-headed recklessness.
He was resolved to solve the problem&ndash;&ndash;but
after all it could abide his more thorough preparation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come back,&#8221; he ordered, turning to the impetuous
M&ocirc;. &#8220;She says they are too many for us two. They
have killed five of her people. We will go back to
the Caves, and after three sleeps for good counsel, we
will return with fire and find the destroying Thing.&#8221;</p>
<p style='text-align:center;margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1em;'>II</p>
<p>On their return to the Caves, Gr&ocirc;m gave the
strange woman and her baby to his faithful slave
Ook-ootsk, who accepted the gift with enthusiasm because,
being a Bow-leg, he had not been allowed to
take any of the Cave Women to wife. He lavished
his attentions upon the unhappy stranger, but he
could make no more of her speech than Gr&ocirc;m had
done. The girl A-ya, however, in a moment of
peculiar insight had gathered, or thought she gathered,
from the stranger&#8217;s signs, that the dreadful and destroying
Thing was something that flew&ndash;&ndash;therefore,
a great flesh-eating bird. But she gathered, also, that
it was something which in some way bore a resemblance
to fire&ndash;&ndash;for the woman, after getting over her first
terror of the dancing flames, kept pointing to them
and then to her wounds in a most suggestive way.
This, however, as Gr&ocirc;m rather scornfully pointed out,
was too absurd. There was nothing that could be in
the least like fire itself; and the wounds of the fugitives
had no likeness whatever to the corrosive bites of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
flame. A-ya took the correction submissively, but held
her own thought; and when a day or two later, events
proved her to have been right, she discreetly refrained
from calling her lord&#8217;s attention to the fact&ndash;&ndash;a point
upon which Gr&ocirc;m was equally reserved.</p>
<p>With so provocative a mystery waiting to be solved,
Gr&ocirc;m could not long rest idle. Had she not known
well it would be a waste of breath, A-ya would have
tried to dissuade him from the perilous, and to her
mind profitless, adventure. It was one she shrank
from in spite of her tried courage and her unwavering
trust in Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s prowess. The mystery of it daunted
her. She feared it in the same way that she feared
the dark. But she kept her fears to herself, and
claimed her long-established right to go with Gr&ocirc;m
on the expedition. Gr&ocirc;m was willing enough, for
there was no one whose readiness and nerve, in a
supreme crisis, he could so depend upon, and he wanted
her close at hand with her fire-basket. There was
nothing to keep her at home, as the children were
looked after by Ook-ootsk.</p>
<p>It was a very little party which started southward
from the Caves&ndash;&ndash;simply Gr&ocirc;m, A-ya, young M&ocirc;, and
a dwarfish kinsman of Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s, named Loob, who was
the swiftest runner in the tribe and noted for his
cunning as a scout. He could go through underbrush
like a shadow, and hide where there was apparently no
hiding-place, making himself indistinguishable from
the surroundings like a squatting partridge. Each one
carried a bow, two light spears, and a club&ndash;&ndash;except
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
A-ya, who had no club, and only one spear. The
weapon she chiefly relied upon was the bow, which she
loved with passion. She considered herself the inventor
of it; and in the accuracy of her shooting she
outdid even Gr&ocirc;m. In addition to these weapons,
each member of the party except the leader himself
carried a fire-basket, in which a mass of red coals
mixed with punk smouldered in a bed of moist clay.</p>
<p>The little expedition traveled Indian file, Gr&ocirc;m leading
the way, with A-ya at his heels, then Loob the
Scout, and young M&ocirc; bringing up the rear. They had
started about dawn, when the first of the morning rose
was just beginning to pale the cave-mouth fires. They
traveled swiftly, but every two hours or so they would
make a brief halt beside a spring to drink and breathe
themselves and to look to the precious fires in the fire-baskets.
When it wanted perhaps an hour of noon,
they came to a little patch of meadow surrounding a
solitary Judas-tree covered with bloom. Here they
built a fire, for the replenishing of the coals in the fire-baskets,
and as a menace to prowling beasts. Then
they dined on their sun-dried meat and on ripe plantains
gathered during the journey. Having dined, the three
younger members of the party stretched themselves out
in the shade for their noon sleep, while Gr&ocirc;m, whose
restless brain never suffered him to sleep by day, kept
watch, and pondered the adventure which lay before
them.</p>
<p>As Gr&ocirc;m sat there, ten or a dozen paces from the
fire, absorbed in thought, his eyes gradually focussed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
themselves upon a big purple-and-lemon orchid bloom,
which glowed forth conspicuously from the rank green
jungle-growth fringing the meadow. The gorgeous
bloom seemed to rise out of a black, curiously gnarled
elbow of branch or trunk which thrust itself out
through the leafage. Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s eyes dwelt for a time,
unheeding, upon this piece of misshapen tree trunk.
Suddenly he saw the blackness wink. His startled
vision cleared itself instantly, and revealed to him the
hideous, two-horned mask of a black rhinoceros, peering
forth just under the orchid blossom.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s first impulse was to wake the sleepers with
a yell and shepherd them to refuge in the tree&ndash;&ndash;for the
gigantic woolly rhinoceros, with his armor of impenetrable
hide, was a foe whom Man had not yet
learned to handle with any certainty. But a deeper
instinct held Gr&ocirc;m motionless. He knew that the
monster, whose eyesight was always dim and feeble,
could not see him distinctly, and was in all probability
staring in stupid wonder at the dancing flames of the
camp-fire. As long as no smell of man should reach
the brute&#8217;s sensitive nostrils to rouse its rage, it was
not likely to charge. There was no wind, and the air
about him was full of the spicy bitterness of the wood-smoke.
Gr&ocirc;m decided that the safest thing was to keep
perfectly still and wait for the next move in the game
to come from the monster. He devoutly trusted that
the sleepers behind him were sleeping soundly, and that
no one would wake and sit up to attract the monster&#8217;s
attention.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m could now see plainly that it was the fire, and
not himself, which the rhinoceros was staring at. The
shifting flames, and the smell of the smoke, apparently
puzzled it. After a moment or two, it took a step
forward, so that half of its huge, black, shaggy bulk
projected from the banked greenery as from a frame.
Then it stood motionless, blinking its little malignant
eyes, till the silent suspense grew to be a strain even
upon Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s well-seasoned nerves.</p>
<p>At last a large stick, laid across the fire, burned
through and fell apart. The flames leapt upwards with
redoubled vigor, preceded by a volley of crackling
sparks. Knowing the temper of the rhinoceros, Gr&ocirc;m
expected it to fly into a fury and charge upon the fire
at once. His mouth opened, indeed, for the yell of
warning which should wake the sleepers and send them
leaping into the tree. But he checked himself in time.
The monster, for once in its life, seemed to be abashed.
The curling red flames were too elusive a foe for it.
With a grunt of uneasiness, it drew back into the
leafage; and in a moment or two Gr&ocirc;m heard the
giant bulk crashing off through the jungle at a gallop.
The unwonted sensation of alarm, once yielded to,
had swollen to a panic, and the dull-witted brute fled
on for a mile or more before it could forget the cause
of its terror.</p>
<p>That afternoon toward sundown the expedition
reached the point where the fugitive had made her
appeal to Gr&ocirc;m. For fear of giving information to
the unknown enemy, no fires were lighted. The night
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
was passed in a dense and lofty tree-top. For Gr&ocirc;m,
strung up with excitement, suspense and curiosity,
there was little sleep. For the most part he perched
on his woven platform with his arms about his knees,
listening to the sounds of the night&ndash;&ndash;the occasional
sudden rush of a hunting beast, the agonized scream and
scuffle, the gurglings and noisy slaverings that told of
the unseen tragedies enacted far down in the murderous
dark. But there was no sound novel to his own
experience. Once there came a scratching of claws
and a sniffing at the base of the tree.</p>
<p>But Gr&ocirc;m dropped a live coal from his fire-basket,
and chanced to make a lucky shot. With a snarl
some heavy body bounced away from the tree. The
coal then fell into a tuft of dry grass, which flared
up suddenly. Gr&ocirc;m had a glimpse of huge shapes
and startled, savage eyes backing away from the circle
of light. The blaze died down as quickly as it had
arisen; and thereafter the night prowlers kept at a
distance from the tree. But the sleepers had all been
thoroughly aroused and till dawn they sat discussing,
for the hundredth time, the chances of the morrow&#8217;s
venture.</p>
<p>Before the sun was clear of the horizon, the little
party was again upon the march, but now going with
the wariness of a sable. They no longer went Indian
file, but flitting singly from tree to tree, from covert
to covert, Gr&ocirc;m picking up the old trail of the fugitive,
the rest of the party keeping him in view and peering
ahead for some sign of the unknown Terror. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
red woman in her flight had left a sharp trail enough;
but in the lapse of three days it had been so obliterated
that all Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s wood-craft was needed to decipher it,
and his progress was slow. He began to be puzzled
at the absence of any other trail, of any footsteps of a
mysterious, unknown monster. Such tracks as crossed
those of the fugitive, however terrible, were all familiar
to his eye.</p>
<p>Suddenly he almost stumbled over a hideous sight.
A low whistle brought his followers closing in upon
him. The skeleton of a full-grown man lay outstretched
in the grass. The bones were fresh&ndash;&ndash;bloodstained
and bright&ndash;&ndash;and a swarm of blood-sucking
insects arose from them. They were picked minutely
clean, except for a portion of the skull, where the
long, strong, densely matted hair seemed to have served
as an effective armor. The bones were not pulled
about, or crushed for their marrow, as they would
have been if the victim had been the prey of any of
the great carnivorous beasts. And there were no
tracks about it save those of a few small rat-like
creatures. It was clear that the Mystery, whatever it
might be, had wings.</p>
<p>&#8220;A bird!&#8221; whispered A-ya, with a gleam of triumph
in her eyes, at the same time glancing up into the
tree-tops apprehensively. But Gr&ocirc;m did not think so.
There were no marks of mighty claws on the turf
around the skeleton.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m cast about him an eager but anxious eye.
The country was not densely wooded at this point,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
but studded with low thickets, and set here and there
with scattered trees. From a little way ahead came a
gleam of calm water through the greenery. It was a
scene of peace, and security, and summer loveliness.
Its very beauty seemed to Gr&ocirc;m an added menace, as
if some peculiar treachery must lurk behind it.</p>
<p>In the center of an open glade, not far from the
skeleton, Gr&ocirc;m set his party to building a circle of
fires, as likely to afford the surest kind of a refuge.
A supply of fuel having been gathered, he directed
A-ya and M&ocirc; to remain and tend the fires and not to
leave the circle unless he should summon them. Loob,
the cunning scout, he sent off to the left through the
underbrush. He himself followed the trail of the
fugitive&ndash;&ndash;now doubled by that of the other fugitive
whose skeleton lay there in the sun&ndash;&ndash;down toward
that gleam of water through the trees. A-ya gazed
after him anxiously as he vanished, half minded to
dare his displeasure and follow him.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m was presently able to make out that the
water was a wide, reedy lake or the arm of a shallow
river. There was no wind, and the surface shone
like clear glass. But once and again his eyes were
dazzled by a dart of intense radiance, a great flash
of rose or violet or blue-green flame, shooting over
the surface of the water. A memory of what A-ya
had professed to gather from the stranger woman
rushed into his mind. Perhaps the Destroying Thing
was like a bird, and nevertheless, at the same time,
something like fire. He felt himself confronted by a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
mystery which made even his tried nerves creep; and
he hid himself in the densest undergrowth as he stole
forward toward the water. He had forgotten, and
forsaken, the trail he was following, in his haste to
solve the problem of those darting splendors.</p>
<p>A few moments more and he gained the edge of an
open glade which led straight to the water. He paused
behind the screening leaves. Out over the water a
bar of ruby light, surrounded by a globe of rose-pink
mist, shot by and vanished from his narrow field of
vision. He was just about to thrust out his head
and crane his neck to follow the gorgeous apparition,
when a peculiar dry rustling in the air above checked
him. He glanced up cautiously, and saw hovering,
not more than twenty or thirty yards away, a beautiful
and dreadful being.</p>
<p>In shape it was exactly like a dragon-fly; but the
length of its flaming violet body was greater than that
of Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s longest arrow. The spread of its two
pairs of transparent, crystal-shining, colorless wings
was even greater than the length of its body. Its
enormous eyes, wells of purple fire which took up the
whole of the top and sides of its monstrous head,
seemed to see everywhere at once; and Gr&ocirc;m shivered
with the feeling that they had spied him out and were
peering into his very soul.</p>
<p>The awful eyes may have seen him, indeed; but at
that moment they spied out something else which apparently
concerned them more. With a pounce like
a flash of violet lightning&ndash;&ndash;and, indeed, almost as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
swift&ndash;&ndash;the bright shape swooped to the grass. The
four shining wings waved there for a moment, and
there seemed to be a mild struggle. Then the giant
fly rose again, lightly, into the air, holding in the
clutch of its six slender, jointed legs the body of one
of those black, rat-like animals which Gr&ocirc;m knew so
well as infesting the grass of all meadows near the
water. The captor flew to a naked branch near the
waterside, alighted upon it, and proceeded to make its
meal, holding up the body between the end joints of
its front pair of legs and turning it over and over
deftly while its appalling jaws both crushed and
mangled it. The process was amazingly swift. In
the space of a couple of minutes all the blood, flesh, and
soft material of the rat were squeezed out and sucked
down. The remnants were rolled into a hard little
ball, perfectly spherical, and scornfully tossed aside.
And the monster, leaping into the air with a rustle
of its glittering wings, flashed off over the water.</p>
<p>Almost in the same moment an amazingly loud
rustle, like the sweep of a fierce gust of rain upon
a rank of palmetto leaves, filled the air above the
glade, and Gr&ocirc;m, looking up with a start, saw a great
shoal of the radiant shapes storm by, as if with the
rainbow entangled in their wings. He wondered upon
what foray they were bent; and now for the first time
he realized, with a creeping of the flesh, what it was
that had overtaken the man whose skeleton he had
found in the grass. The shoal swept out over the
lake a little way, and then down the shore toward the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
left; and Gr&ocirc;m drew a long breath as he assured himself
that their course was taking them far from the
fires of A-ya and M&ocirc;.</p>
<p>When Gr&ocirc;m lowered his eyes to earth again he
started. On the side of the stump of a fallen tree,
out in the glade not more than eight or ten yards
distant, clung one of the monsters, scintillating blue-green
and amethyst in the full blaze of the sun. Its
wings, exquisitely netted and of crystal transparency,
were tinged with an ineffable purple iridescence. Its
jointed body, slightly longer than Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s arm, was
nearly as thick as his wrist, and ended at the tail with
a formidable double claw. Its six legs, arranged in
three pairs under the thorax, were armed on the inner
sides with powerful spines, needle-pointed and steel
hard, with which to grip and hold its victims. The
thorax, from the back of which sprouted the four great
wings, was of the thickness of Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s forearm, while
its head was as big as Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s two great fists put
together. It was this head which held Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s fascinated
gaze, giving him more of the sensation of
cold fear than he had ever known before. More than
two-thirds of the head consisted of a pair of huge,
globose eyes, without pupil, ethereally transparent, yet
unfathomable. From the depths of them flamed a
ceaselessly changing radiance of blue-green, purple and
violet. Gr&ocirc;m found the stare of those blank, pupilless
eyes almost intolerable.</p>
<p>It was plainly straight at him, through the ineffectual
screen of the leafage, that the dreadful insect was staring.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
At first it stared with the back of its head.
Then, very deliberately, it turned its head completely
around, without moving its body a hair-breadth, till
its mouth was in the same plane with its back. This
gave Gr&ocirc;m a sense of disgust, and his shrinking dread
began to give way to a sort of rage.</p>
<p>Then he took note of the monster&#8217;s mouth&ndash;&ndash;and
understood those great cup-shaped wounds on the
woman and the child. The mouth took up the remaining
third of the head, and seemed to consist of
globular discs working one over the other, so as either
to cut cleanly or to grind. They were working, slowly,
now&ndash;&ndash;and Gr&ocirc;m felt suddenly that he must put a stop
to it, that he must put out the awful light in those
monstrous devil eyes. Stealthily, almost imperceptibly,
he fitted an arrow to his bow, raised it, drew
it, and took a long, steady aim. He must not miss.
The shaft flew&ndash;&ndash;and the great fly was pinned, through
the thorax, to the soft, rotten wood of its perch.</p>
<p>To Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s horror that stroke, which to any beast he
knew would have at once been fatal, did not kill the
monstrous fly. Its struggles, and the beating of its
four great wings were so violent that the arrow-head
was presently wrenched loose from its hold in the
wood, and the raging splendor, with the shaft half-way
through its thorax, bounded into the air. It
darted straight at Gr&ocirc;m, who had prudently edged
in among a tangle of stems. Its fury carried it
through the screen of leafage&ndash;&ndash;but then, its wings
impeded by the branches, and the arrow hampering it,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
it dashed itself to the earth. Instantly Gr&ocirc;m was
upon it, stamping its slim body, as it lay there blazing
and quivering, into the soil. The violet light in the
huge, pupilless eyes still stared up at him implacable,
from a head turned squarely over the back. But in
a cold fury Gr&ocirc;m shattered the gleaming head with
his club. Then he trod the silver wings to dust.</p>
<p>Having slaked his wrath effectually, Gr&ocirc;m turned
to stare forth again at those destroying splendors
darting and glittering above the surface of the lake.
To his surprise there were no more of them to be seen.
Then far off down the shore he heard the voice of
Loob, shouting for help. The shouting changed at
once to a scream of terror, and Gr&ocirc;m started to the
rescue on the full run&ndash;&ndash;taking care, however, to keep
within cover of the thickets. But before he had gone
a quarter of a mile he heard A-ya&#8217;s voice calling him,
wildly, insistently, mingled with excited yells from M&ocirc;.
He shouted in reply and dashed madly for the fires.
The peril of A-ya put all other considerations out of
his mind.</p>
<p>As he burst forth into the glade of refuge, he
saw A-ya and young M&ocirc; leaping about frantically
among their fires, now trying to stir the fires to a
fiercer blaze, now beating upwards with their spears,
while above them darted and gleamed and swooped and
scintillated, with a horrid dry rustling of their silver
wings, shoal upon shoal of the devouring monsters.
As he burst into the open, with a great shout of encouragement,
something dropped upon him. He felt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
his head instantly caged by six steel-like legs which
gripped like jaws, their spines sinking deep into the
flesh of neck and cheek. He reached up his left hand,
caught his dreadful assailant just where the head and
thorax join, and strove to throttle it. This was impossible,
by reason of the insect&#8217;s armor, but he succeeded
in holding off those horrid jaws from his face
as he dashed for the circle. Another monster swooped
and struck its spines into his back, and bit a great
mouthful out of his shoulder. But he gained the fires,
and, holding his breath, sprang right through the
fiercest flame. The wings of his assailants shrivelled
instantly, and the flame, drawn into the mouth of their
breathing tubes, sealed them up. Gr&ocirc;m tore them off,
and slammed the writhing, wingless bodies into the
fire.</p>
<p>Inside the circle, now that the fires were burning
high, it was possible to defend oneself effectually, as
the bulk of the assailants seemed to realize that the
flames were fatal to their frail wings. But there were
enough so headlong in their ferocity that both Gr&ocirc;m
and M&ocirc; were kept busy beating them off with spears,
while A-ya fed the fires; and the ground inside the
circle was littered with the radiant bodies of the dying
insects, which, even in dying, bit like bull-dogs if foot
or leg came within reach. Gr&ocirc;m noticed that their
supply of fuel was all but gone, and his heart sank.
He measured with his eyes the distance to the nearest
thickets that looked dense enough for a shelter.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to run for those bushes,&#8221; he said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
presently. &#8220;They can&#8217;t fly in where the branches are
thick. It breaks their wings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said young M&ocirc;. But A-ya, whose shapely
shoulders and thighs were already covered with hideous
wounds, trembled at the prospect.</p>
<p>At that moment, however an amazing change came
over the scene. A black thunder-cloud passed across
the face of the sun. The moment the sunshine
vanished the destroyers seemed to forget their fury.
All the life and energy went out of them. They simply
flocked to the nearest trees and hung themselves up,
gigantic, jewelled blooms, upon the branches. In less
than a minute every dreadful wing was stilled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now is our time. Come!&#8221; commanded Gr&ocirc;m,
leading the way out of the circle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s stop and kill them all!&#8221; pleaded young M&ocirc;,
his eyes red with rage.</p>
<p>But Gr&ocirc;m pointed to the cloud. &#8220;It will pass
quickly,&#8221; said he. &#8220;We must be far from here before
the sun shows his face again.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused, however, to transfix upon his spear-head
one of their wounded but still fluttering foes,
that he might be able to show the tribe what manner
of monsters they had had to deal with. Both A-ya
and M&ocirc; followed his example; and they all ran off
down the glade searching for Loob, whom they soon
found and bearing their strange trophies on their spear-heads
they went on. The monsters, clinging sullenly
to their perches, rolled baleful eyes of emerald and
rose and amethyst upon them as they went, but lifted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
never a wing to follow them. Ten minutes later the
sun came out again. Then the monsters all sprang
hurtling into the air, and darted hither and thither
above the glade in shoals of iridescent radiance, seeking
their prey. But Gr&ocirc;m and A-ya, M&ocirc; and Loob
triumphant in spite of their wounds, were by this time
far away among the inland thickets, where those intolerable
eyes could not search them out, nor the clashing
wings pursue.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>THE TERRORS OF THE DARK</h3>
</div>
<p style='text-align:center;'>I</p>
<p>From the topmost summit of that range of
pointed hills which held the caves and the cave-mouth
fires of his people, Gr&ocirc;m stared northward
with keen curiosity. To east and south and west he
had explored, ever seeking to enlarge the knowledge
and strengthen the security of his tribe. But to northward
of the pointed hills lay league on league of profound
jungle&ndash;&ndash;grotesque and enormous growths
knitted together impenetrably by a tangle of gigantic,
flame-flowered lianas. And in those rank, green
glooms, as Gr&ocirc;m had reason to believe, there lurked
such monsters as even he, with all his resources of fire
and novel weapons, had so far shrunk from challenging.</p>
<p>But beyond the expanse of jungle stretched another
line of hills, their summits not saw-toothed like his
own, but low and gently rounded, and of a smoky purple
against the pure turquoise sky. These hills Gr&ocirc;m
was thirsting to explore. They might contain caves
more roomy than those of his own hills&ndash;&ndash;spacious and
suitable to give shelter to his tribe, which was now finding
itself somewhat cramped. Moreover, it had always
seemed to Gr&ocirc;m that there might be a mystery behind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
those hills, and to his restless imagination a mystery
was always like a stinging goad.</p>
<p>In all this neighborhood the crust of earth was thin
as plainly appeared from the fringe of wavering
volcanic flames which, during all the five years since
the coming of the tribe, had been dancing from the
lip of the narrow fissure across the mouth of their
valley. Night and day, now high and vehement, now
low and faint, they had danced there, guarding the
valley entrance&ndash;&ndash;until just one moon ago. Then had
come an earthquake, shaking the hearts of all the tribe
to water. The dancing flames had died. The fissure
had closed up, and its place had been taken by a pool
of boiling pitch. And one of the caves had fallen in,
burying several members of the tribe, who had been too
stupefied with panic to flee into the open at the first
alarm. For some days after this catastrophe the tribe
had camped in the open, huddled about their great
fires. Then, but with deep misgivings, they had all
crowded back into the remaining caves.</p>
<p>But now there was not room enough, and Bawr,
the wise Chief, had taken frequent counsel upon the
matter with Gr&ocirc;m, whom, loving him greatly he called
sometimes his Right Hand and sometimes the Eye
of the People. At last, it had been settled that Gr&ocirc;m
should lead a party through the jungle land to those
other hills, to spy out the prospect. And Gr&ocirc;m, like
the foresighted leader that he was, had spent many
hours on the mountain-top, planning his route and
studying the luxuriant surface of the jungle outstretched
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
below him, before plunging into its mysterious
depths.</p>
<p>As was his custom when on a perilous venture,
Gr&ocirc;m would have few followers to share the peril
with him. He took A-ya, not only because of her
oft-proved courage and resourcefulness, not only because
he wanted her always at his side, but, above
all, because he knew he could not leave her behind.
Had he tried to leave her, she would have disobeyed
and followed him by stealth&ndash;&ndash;and perhaps fallen a
prey to prowling beasts. He took also A-ya&#8217;s young
brother, the hot-head M&ocirc;; and Loob, the shaggy, little
sharp-faced scout, who could run like a hare, hide like
a fox, and fight like a cornered weasel. This he would
have accounted, ordinarily, a sufficient party. But the
present enterprise being one of peculiar difficulty, he
decided at the last moment to strengthen his following
by the addition of a dark-faced, perpetually-grinning
giant named Hobbo, who was slow of wit, but thewed
like a bull, and a mighty fighter with the stone-headed
club.</p>
<p>This little but greatly daring band, which Gr&ocirc;m,
one flaming sunrise, led down into the unknown jungle,
was well armed. Besides the spear and the club, each
member of the party but Hobbo (who had displayed no
aptitude for its use) carried Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s wonderful invention&ndash;&ndash;the
bow. Hobbo, however, because of his
immense strength, bore the heavy fire-basket, wherein
the smoldering coals were cherished in a bed of clay.
As a food reserve, everyone carried a few strips of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
half-dried meat; but their main dependence, of course,
was to be upon the spoils of their hunting and the
fruits that they might gather on their march.</p>
<p>The forest into whose depths Gr&ocirc;m now led the way
was in reality a survival from a previous age, into
which the forms, both vegetable and animal, of contemporary
life had been gradually infiltrating. The
soil, of incredible fertility, still poured forth those
gigantic tree grasses, and colossal, sappy ferns and
psuedo-palms, which had flourished chiefly in the
carboniferous period. But here they were mingled
with the more enduring hard-wood growths of the later
tropical forests; and only these were strong enough to
support the massive, strangling coils of the cable-like
lianas, which wound their way up the huge trunks and
reached out in a&euml;rial, swaying bridges from tree-top
to tree-top. On every side, high or low, the deep-green
gloom was splashed with color from the gorgeous
orchids and other epiphytes, which flowered out into
grotesque or monstrous wing-petaled shapes of vermilion
and purple and orange and rose and white,
eyed with velvet black or streaked with iridescent
bronze.</p>
<p>To men of to-day this jungle would have been impenetrable,
except by the incessant use of axe or
machete. But Gr&ocirc;m and his party were Cave-Men,
and had not yet forgotten all the instincts and capacities
of their tree-dwelling ancestors. Sometimes,
where it seemed easiest, they forced their way along
the ground, or followed the trodden trail of some great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
jungle beast, so long as it led in the right direction.
But here they had to be ceaselessly on the watch
against surprise by creatures whose monstrous tracks
were unlike any that they had ever seen before.
Whenever possible, therefore, they preferred to
journey, after the fashion of their apish ancestors, by
way of the high branches and the liana bridges.
Hampered as they were by their weapons, their
progress by this a&euml;rial way was slow. But it was
comparatively secure. And it was also comparatively
cool; while down at the ground-level the steaming heat
and the stinging insects were almost beyond endurance.</p>
<p>Yet before the end of that first day&#8217;s journey they
learned that even in tree-tops it was necessary to be
always on the watch. Once the little hairy scout,
Loob, who traveled always on the outskirts of the
party, was struck at suddenly by a huge black leopard,
which lay ambushed in the crotch of a tree. Loob,
however, who was so quick-sighted that he seemed to
see things before they actually happened, leapt to a
higher branch in time to escape the deadly paw. In
the next instant he struck down furiously with his
spear, catching his assailant between the shoulder-blades
and driving the stroke home with all his strength.
With a screech, the beast stiffened out, and then, somewhat
slowly, collapsed. As Loob wrenched his weapon
free, the great animal slumped limply from its branch.
For a moment or two it hung by the fore-paws, coughing
and frothing at the mouth. Then this last hold
relaxed and it fell, bumping with a curious deliberation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
from branch to branch. It vanished through a
floor of thick leafage, and struck the ground with a
dull crash. It must have fallen under the very jaws
of an unseen waiting monster; for there arose at once
a strange, hooting roar, followed by the sound of
rending flesh and cracking bone. Loob grinned over
his feat, and Gr&ocirc;m, glancing at A-ya, muttered quietly:
&#8220;It is better to be up here than down there.&#8221; As he
spoke, and they all peered downwards, a dreadful
head, with the limp body of the leopard gripped like a
rat between its long jaws and dripping yellow fang,
thrust itself up through the floor of leafage and stared
at them with round eyes as cold and black as ice.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m itched to shoot an arrow into one of those
unwinking, devilish eyes. But arrows were too
precious to be wasted.</p>
<p>That night they slept profoundly on a platform
which they wove of branches in one of the tallest and
most unscalable trees. They kept watch, of course,
turn and turn about; but nothing attempted to approach
them, and they cared little for the sounds of
strife, the crashings of pursuit and desperate flight,
which came up to them at intervals from the blackness
far below.</p>
<p>On the morrow, however, as they were pursuing
their a&euml;rial path along the borders of a narrow, sluggish
bayou, they were suddenly made to realize that
the tree-tops held perils more deadly than that of the
lurking leopards. They were all staring down into the
water, which swarmed with gigantic crocodiles and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
boiled immediately beneath them with the turmoil of a
life-and-death struggle between two of the brutes, when
harsh jabbering in the branches just across the water
made them look up.</p>
<p>The tree-tops opposite were full of great apes, mowing
and gibbering at them with every sign of hate.
The beasts were as big and massive as Hobbo himself,
and covered thickly with long, blackish fur. Their
faces, half human, half dog-like, were hairless and of
a bright but bilious blue, with great livid red circles
about the small, furious eyes. With derisive gestures
they swung themselves out upon the overhanging
branches, till it almost seemed as if they would hurl
themselves into the water in their rage against the
little knot of human beings.</p>
<p>The girl A-ya, overcome with loathing horror because
the beasts were so hideous a caricature of man,
covered her eyes with one hand. Young M&ocirc;, his fiery
temper stung by their challenge, clapped an arrow to
his string and raised his bow to shoot. But Gr&ocirc;m
checked him sternly, dreading to fix any thirst of vengeance
in the minds of the terrible troop.</p>
<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t come at us here. Let them forget about
us,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Don&#8217;t take any more notice of them at
all.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he led the way once more through the branches
along the edge of the bayou, the apes kept pace with
them on the other side. But presently the bayou
widened, and then swept sharply off to the west. Gr&ocirc;m
kept on straight to the north, by the route which he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
planned. And the mad gibbering died away into the
hot, green silence of the tree-tops.</p>
<p>The adventurers now pushed on with redoubled
speed, unwilling to pass another night in the tree-tops
when such dangerous antagonists were in the neighborhood.
The hills, however, were still far off when
evening came again. Not knowing that the great
apes always slept at night, Gr&ocirc;m decided to continue
the journey in order to lessen the risk of a surprise.
When the moon rose, round and huge and honey-colored,
over the sea of foliage, traveling through the
tree-tops was almost as easy as by day, while the
earth below them, with its prowling and battling monsters,
was buried in inky gloom. When day broke,
there were the rounded hills startlingly close ahead,
as if they had crept forward to meet them in the
night.</p>
<p>And now the hills looked different. Between the
nearest&ndash;&ndash;a long, rolling, treeless ridge of downland&ndash;&ndash;and
the edge of the jungle lay an expanse of open,
grassy savannah, dotted with ponds, and here and there
a curious, solitary, naked tree-trunk, with what looked
like a bunch of grass on its top. They were like gigantic
green paint-brushes, with yellow-gray handles,
stuck up at random. Far off they saw a herd of
curious beasts at pasture, and away to the left a giant
bird, as tall as the tree by which it stood, seemed to
keep watch. A little to the right, where the treeless
ridge came abruptly to an end, gleamed a considerable
stretch of water. It was toward this point, where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
the water washed the steep-shouldered promontory,
that Gr&ocirc;m decided to shape his course across the
plain.</p>
<p>By the time the sun was some three hours high
they had arrived within a couple of hundred yards
of the open. Sick of the oppressive jungle, and eager
for the change to a type of country with which they
were more familiar, they were swinging on through
the tree-tops at a great pace, when that savage, snarling
jabber which they so dreaded was heard in the
branches behind them. Gr&ocirc;m instantly put A-ya in
the lead, while he himself dropped to the rear to meet
this deadliest of perils. There was no need to urge
his party to haste; but it seemed to them all as if they
were standing still, so swiftly did the clamor of the
apes come upon them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Down to earth,&#8221; ordered Gr&ocirc;m sharply, seeing that
they must be overtaken before they could reach the
open, and realizing that in the tree-tops they could
not hope to match these four-handed dwellers of the
trees.</p>
<p>As they dropped nimbly from branch to branch,
the foremost of the apes arrived in sight, set up a
screech of triumph, and came swooping down after
them in vast, swinging leaps. In the hurry Hobbo
dropped his fire-basket, which broke as it fell and
scattered the precious coals. Gr&ocirc;m, guarding the rear
of the flight, made the mistake of keeping his eye
too much on the enemy, too little on where he was
going. In a moment or two, he found himself cut
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
off, upon a branch from which there was no escape
without a drop of twenty feet to a most uncertain
foothold. Rather than risk it, he ran in upon his
nearest assailant at the base of the branch, thrusting
at the blue-faced beast with his spear. But his position
being so insecure, his thrust lacked force and precision.
The great ape caught it deftly; and Gr&ocirc;m, to preserve
his balance, had to let the spear be wrenched from his
hand. At the same moment another ape dropped on
the branch behind him.</p>
<p>For just one second Gr&ocirc;m thought his hour had
come. He crouched to steady himself, then darted forward
and hurled his club straight at his foe&#8217;s protruding
and shaggy paunch. Again the beast caught the
missile in its lightning clutch; but in the next instant
it threw up its long arms, without a sound, and fell
backwards out of the tree. A-ya, who had been the
first to reach the ground, had drawn her bow and shot
upwards with sure aim. The shaft had caught the
great ape under the center of the jaw, far back at the
throat, and pierced straight up to the brain.</p>
<p>Surprised at seeing their leader fall with so little
apparent reason, the other apes halted for a moment
in their onset, chattering noisily. In that moment
Gr&ocirc;m swung himself to the ground. As he reached
it both M&ocirc; and Loob discharged their arrows. Another
ape fell from his perch, but caught himself on
a lower branch and hung there writhing; while a
third, with a shaft half buried in his paunch, fled back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
yelling into the tree-top. Then the adventurers
snatched up their fallen weapons from the ground and
made for the open as fast as they could run. And the
apes, with a hellish uproar of barks and screams, came
swarming after them through the lower branches.</p>
<p>At this point, fortunately for the travelers, the jungle
was already thinning, and they had a chance to show
their speed. The raging blue-faces were speedily distanced,
and the fugitives ran out breathless upon the
sunny savannah. Here, feeling themselves safe, they
halted to look back. The lower branches all along
the edge of the grass were thronged with leaping
brown forms, and gnashing blue masks, and red-rimmed,
devilish eyes. But not one of the great beasts,
for all their rage, seemed willing to venture forth into
the open.</p>
<p>&#8220;There must be something out here that they fear
greatly,&#8221; commented Gr&ocirc;m, peering warily about him.
But there was nothing in sight to suggest any danger,
and he led the way onward through the rank grass at
a long, leisurely trot.</p>
<p style='text-align:center;margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1em;'>II</p>
<p>For the most part the grass grew hardly waist
high; but here and there were patches, perhaps an
acre or so in extent, where it was more cane than
grass and rose to a height of twelve or fifteen feet.
To such patches, which might serve as lurking-places
to unknown monsters, Gr&ocirc;m gave a wide berth. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
had a vivid remembrance of that colossal head, with
the awful dead eyes, which had reared itself through
the leafage to stare up at him.</p>
<p>In spite of the strange and enormous trails which
crossed their path at times; in spite of occasional massive
swayings and crashings in the deep beds of cane,
the adventurous party accomplished the journey across
the savannah without encountering a single foe. The
mid-noon blaze of the sun upon the windless grass,
which was almost more than they could endure, was
probably keeping the monsters to their lairs; and the
only living things to be seen, besides the insects and a
high-wheeling vulture or two, were a few shy troops
of a kind of small antelope, incredibly swift of foot.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m drew a breath of relief as they reached the
foot of the hills. But just here it was impossible to
climb them. A range of high limestone downs, they
were fringed at this point by an unbroken line of
cliff, perpendicular and at times overhanging, from
forty or fifty to perhaps a couple of hundred feet in
height, and so smooth that even these goat-footed
cave-folk could not scale them. The rich plain-land
at their feet had once been a shallow, inland sea, and
now its grasses washed along their base in a gold-green,
scented foam.</p>
<p>Turning to the right, Gr&ocirc;m led the way close along
the cliff-foot toward the water, which glowed like
brass about a mile ahead. Along the right of their
path the ground sloped off gently to a belt of that high
cane-like growth which Gr&ocirc;m regarded with such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
suspicion. Before they had gone many hundred yards
his suspicion was more than justified.</p>
<p>From a little way behind them there arose all at
once a chorus of explosive gruntings, mixed with a
huge crashing of the canes. Glancing over their
shoulders, they saw a great rust-red animal, about the
size of a rhinoceros, which burst forth from the canes
and stood staring after them. Its hideous head was
larger than that of any rhinoceros they had ever seen,
and armed with a pair of enormous conical horns,
each more than a foot in diameter at the base and
tapering to a keen point. Set side by side, at a
moderate angle, upon the bridge of the snout, they
were far more terrible than the horns of any rhinoceros.
Their bearer lowered them menacingly, and charged
down upon Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s party with a sound that was something
between the grunting of a hog and the braying of
an ass. Immediately upon his massive heels a whole
herd of the red monsters surged forth from the canes,
and came charging after their leader at a ponderous
gallop which seemed literally to shake the earth.</p>
<p>For a moment or two Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s party had paused,
confident in their own fleetness of foot, and wondering
at that pair of amazing horns on the monster&#8217;s
snout. But when the rest of the terrific herd came
thundering down upon them, they fled in all haste.
To their amazement, they found that their speed was
none too great for their need. The red monsters, in
spite of their bulk, were disconcertingly swift.</p>
<p>As he neared the swift promontory which terminated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
with the range of downs, Gr&ocirc;m began to fear that he
and his followers would have to take refuge in the
water. This water, as it chanced, was the brackish
estuary of a river which, sweeping down from the
east, here made its way to the sea through a long,
slanting break in the limestone hills. It was now
near low tide, and there opened before the hard-pressed
fugitives, as they approached the shore, a strip of
damp beach running around the base of the bluff. As
they left the grass and ran out upon the beach they
were astonished to find that the thundering pursuit had
stopped short. Just at the turn of the cliff they halted
and stared back wonderingly. Their pursuers, though
swinging their great horns and braying with rage, were
evidently unwilling to venture so near the waterside.
They drew back, indeed, as if they feared it, and at
last went crashing away into the canes. The fugitives,
glad of an opportunity to rest their laboring lungs,
squatted down with their backs against the cliff and
congratulated themselves on having got rid of such
perilous attentions. But Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s sagacious eyes
searched the cliff face anxiously, without neglecting to
watch the unruffled water. If that water was so
dreaded that even the mighty herd of their pursuers
durst not approach it, surely its smiling surface must
hide some peril of surpassing horror.</p>
<p>For the next few hundred yards, till it vanished
around the curve, the strip of naked beach was not
more than twenty or thirty feet in width. Not without
some apprehensions, Gr&ocirc;m decided to push forward.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
There seemed nothing else to do, indeed, seeing
that the cane-beds behind them were occupied by that
irresistible red herd. Somewhere ahead, he argued,
there must be a break in the cliff which would give
access to the rolling downs above, where they might
travel in safety.</p>
<p>Disguising his growing uneasiness that he might
not discourage his followers&ndash;&ndash;who were now
full of elation at having reached the foot of the hills&ndash;&ndash;he
led on again in haste, though there seemed to be
no need of haste. Both Hobbo and young M&ocirc;, indeed,
were for staying a while and sleeping in the shade
of an overhanging rock. But A-ya, who sensed
through sympathy her lord&#8217;s disquietude, and the little
scout Loob, who was always, on principle, ill at
ease in any spot where there was no tree to climb,
were as eager as their chief to push ahead; and the
others would never have dared, in any case, to question
Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s decision.</p>
<p>As they rounded the next bend of the cliff, however,
a clamor of excited satisfaction arose from all
the party. Straight ahead, and not fifty paces distant,
there opened before them a spacious cave-mouth, with
a somewhat wider strip of beach before it. Immediately
beyond the cave the strip of beach came
sharply to an end, and the tide lapped softly against the
foot of the cliff.</p>
<p>But just then, in the moment of their elation, a
terrifying thing happened. As if aroused by their
voices, the still surface a few yards from shore boiled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
up, and was lashed to foam by the strokes of a gigantic
tail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Run!&#8221; yelled Gr&ocirc;m; and they all dashed forward,
there being no chance to go back. In the same instant,
an appalling head&ndash;&ndash;like that of a thrice magnified and
distorted crocodile, with vast, round, painted eyes&ndash;&ndash;was
upthrust from the water and came rushing after
them at a pace which sent up a curving wave before
it.</p>
<p>Quick as thought, Gr&ocirc;m drew his bow and shot
at the appalling head. The arrow drove straight into
the gaping throat, eliciting a thunderous bellow of
rage, but producing no other effect. Then Gr&ocirc;m
sprang after his fleeing companions, and raced for
his life toward the cave mouth. The cave might be
nothing more than a death-trap for them all; but it
seemed to offer the one possibility of escape.</p>
<p>As they dashed into the cave the awful, gaping head
was close behind them. They had a flashing glimpse,
through the gloom, of high-arched distance melting into
blackness, of a strip of black water along the right,
and to the left a gentle ascent of smooth white sand,
whose end was out of sight.</p>
<p>Up this slope they raced, with the clashing of
monstrous fangs close behind them. But they had not
gone a dozen strides when the slope quivered, and
heaved upwards shudderingly beneath them; and they
all fell forward flat upon their faces. From all but
Gr&ocirc;m there went up a shriek so piercing that in their
own ears it disguised the stupendous rending roar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
which at that moment seemed to stun the air. The
mighty arch of the cave mouth had slipped and crashed
down, completely jamming the entrance, and opening
up a gash of blue heaven above their heads.</p>
<p>To Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s unshaken wits, it was clear on the instant
what had happened. He staggered to his feet and
looked back through a rain of falling rock-splinters.
He had a vision of their colossal pursuer, its jaws
stretched to their utmost width, the vast globes of its
eyes protruding from their armored sockets, its ponderous,
bowed fore-legs pawing the air aimlessly in the
final convulsion. The falling rock-mass had caught
it on the middle of the back, crushing its mighty frame
like an eggshell.</p>
<p>For a second or two, Gr&ocirc;m stood there rigid, staring,
his gnarled fingers clenched upon his weapons.
Then a second earthquake tremor beneath his feet
warned him. With an unerring instinct, he sprang on
up the slope after his companions, who had fled as
soon as they could pick themselves up. And in the
next moment the rock above his head, fissured deep by
the rains, slipped again. With a growling screech,
as if torn from the bowels of the mountain, it settled
slowly down, and sealed the mouth of the cave to utter
blackness.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m stopped short, having no mind to dash out
his brains against the rock. There was stillness at
last, and silence save for the faint, humming moan of
the earthquake which seemed to come from vast depths
beneath his feet. Profoundly awed, but master of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
spirit, he stood leaning upon his spear in the thick
dark till the last of that strange humming note had
died away. Then, through a silence so thick it seemed
to choke him, he called aloud:</p>
<p>&#8220;A-ya! where are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Gr&ocirc;m!</i>&#8221; came the girl&#8217;s answer, a sobbing cry of
relief and joy, from almost, as it seemed, beneath his
outstretched hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are all here,&#8221; came the voices of the three men.</p>
<p>They had fallen headlong at the second shock, as
at the first; and in the darkness they had not dared to
rise again, but lay waiting for their leader to tell them
what to do. In half a dozen cautious, groping steps
he was among them, and sank down by A-ya&#8217;s side,
clutching her to him to stop her trembling.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are we to do now?&#8221; asked the girl, after a
long silence. Without Gr&ocirc;m, they would probably
have died where they were, not daring to stir in the
darkness. But their faith in their chief kept them
cheerful even in this desperate plight.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must find a way out,&#8221; answered Gr&ocirc;m, with
resolute confidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Hobbo had not dropped the fire!&#8221; said young
M&ocirc; bitterly.</p>
<p>The giant groaned in self-abasement, and beat his
chest with his great fists. But Gr&ocirc;m, who would allow
no dissensions in his following, answered sternly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Be silent. You might have done no better yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then for a time there was no more said, while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
Gr&ocirc;m, sitting there in the dark with the girl&#8217;s face
buried in his great shaggy chest, thought out his
plans. It was plain to him, from what he had seen
in that last instant of daylight, that the entrance was
blocked impregnably. Moreover, he judged that any
attempt to work an opening in that direction would
be likely, for the present, to bring more rocks down
upon them. It would be better, first, to feel their way
on into the cave in the hope of finding another exit.
He was not afraid of getting lost, no matter how
absolute the dark, because he possessed that sixth sense,
so long ago vanished from modern man&#8217;s equipment&ndash;&ndash;the
sense of direction. He knew that, as a matter
of course, he could find his way back to this starting-point
whenever he would.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; he ordered at last, lifting A-ya and
holding her hand in his grasp. Reaching out with
his spear, he kept tapping the ground before him as
he went, and occasionally the wall upon his left.
Sometimes, too, he would reach upwards to assure
himself that there was no lowering of the rocky ceiling.
A spear&#8217;s length to the right, more or less, he got
always a splash of water.</p>
<p>With their fine senses intensely alert, they were able
to make fair progress, even though unaided by their
eyes. But Gr&ocirc;m checked his advance abruptly. He
had a perception of some obstacle before him. He
reached out his spear as far as he could. It touched
a soft object. The object, whatever it was, surged
violently beneath the touch. His flesh crept, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
shaggy hair uplifted on his neck. &#8220;Back!&#8221; he hissed,
thrusting A-ya off to arm&#8217;s length and bracing his
spear point before him to receive the expected attack.
A pair of faintly phosphorescent eyes, small, but so
wide apart as to show that their owner&#8217;s head must
have been enormous, flashed round upon them. There
was a hoarse squeal of alarm, and a heavy body went
floundering off into the water. They could hear it
swimming away in hot haste.</p>
<p>Every one drew a long breath. Then, after a few
moments, A-ya laughed softly:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good to find something at last that runs away
from us instead of after us!&#8221; said she.</p>
<p>A little further on the cave wall turned to the left.
A few steps, and their path came to an end. There
was water ahead of them, and on both sides. Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s
exploring spear assured them that it was deep water.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must swim,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Leave your clubs behind.&#8221;
And leading the way down into the unknown
tide, he struck out straight ahead.</p>
<p>It was nerve-testing work swimming thus through
that unseen water to an unguessed goal; but Gr&ocirc;m
was unhesitating, and his companions rested upon his
steady will. The water was of a summer warmth,
and slightly salt, which convinced him that it had free
communication with the sunlit tides outside. Several
times he came within touch of the rocky walls of the
cavern, and found that they went straight down to a
depth he could not guess. But he kept on with hope
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
and confidence at a leisurely pace, which, in that bland
and windless flood, he knew that every member of
his party could have maintained for half a day.</p>
<p>Suddenly there appeared ahead of them a faint,
bluish gleam upon the water&#8217;s surface. It was something
elusive and unreal, and vaguely menacing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daylight!&#8221; exclaimed young M&ocirc; eagerly. But
Gr&ocirc;m said nothing. He did not think it was daylight,
and he was apprehensive of some new peril.</p>
<p>The strange light grew and spread. It was evident
now that it rose from the water, and also that it was
advancing rapidly to meet the astonished swimmers.
After a few moments it was bright enough in its blue
pallor to show the swimmers that they were traversing
a vast hall of waters, whose roof was lost in darkness.
Some fifty yards ahead of them, and a little to the
right, a low spit of rock, half awash for the greater
part of its length, ran out slantingly from the wall of
the stupendous chamber.</p>
<p>Toward this ledge Gr&ocirc;m now led the way, hurling
himself through the water on his side at top speed.
He could not fathom this mysterious phosphorescence,
and he wished to get his people out upon dry land
before it reached them. But fast as the adventurers
swam, the ghostly radiance spread faster. Before
they got to the ledge, the light was all about them;
but it seemed to be coming from a great depth.</p>
<p>Nervously they all glanced down, and a low cry
of horror broke from their lips. The depths were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
swarming with monstrous, luminous forms, a moon-bright,
crawling, sliding field of claws and feelers, and
broad, flat backs, and dreadful, protruding eyes.</p>
<p>The eyes all stared straight up at them with a fixed
malignancy that froze even Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s blood. They
seemed innumerable, and all together they came
suddenly floating upwards.</p>
<p>Already the fugitives were dragging themselves
out upon the ledge, in frantic haste, when the diabolical
swarm reached the surface. But Hobbo, who was the
slowest swimmer, was merely clutching at the rock
when the water boiled all about him in a froth of light.
A pair of huge, pincer-like claws seized him by the
neck, and another pair by one arm, plucking him back.
His convulsed face stared upward for an instant, and
then, with a choked scream, he was dragged under.
He disappeared in a swirl of pale blue, frantically
waving claws, and eyes, and feelers, and black-fringed,
chopping mouths.</p>
<p>Beside himself with rage and horror, Gr&ocirc;m stabbed
down wildly into the whirling struggle, and his example
was followed at once by Loob and young M&ocirc;. Some
of their random blows went home, and as one or another
of the gigantic crabs turned over in its death-throes,
its nearest fellows seized it, tore it to pieces,
and devoured it.</p>
<p>But A-ya, who had taken no part in this vengeance,
now snatched Gr&ocirc;m by the arm, shrieking wildly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Look! They are coming out!&#8221;</p>
<p>Recovering their senses, the three half-maddened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
men stared about them. On every side the gigantic
crabs&ndash;&ndash;some with claws eight or ten feet long, and
eyes upon the ends of long waving stalks&ndash;&ndash;were crawling
up upon the ledge.</p>
<p>The ledge, fortunately, was of some width. At its
landward end it rose into a mass of tumbled rocks
perhaps twenty or thirty feet above the water. Toward
this post of vantage the adventurers fought their
way, striking and thrusting desperately with their
spears as the monsters, crowding up from the water
on either side, snatched at them with their terrible
mailed claws. Over and over again one or another of
the party was seized by the foot or the leg; but his
companions would beat the long, jointed limb to fragments,
or drive their spear-points deep into the awful,
drooling mouth, and set him free.</p>
<p>At last, bleeding from many wounds, they reached
the end of the ledge and clambered to the top. Here
but three or four of the giant crustaceans tried to
follow them. These were easily speared from above,
and hurled back disabled among their ravening kin.
And the whole swarm, apparently forgetting their intended
victims as soon as they were out of reach, fell
to fighting hideously among themselves over the convulsed
bodies of these wounded. The lower portion
of the ledge, and the water all about it, was a crawling
mass of horror that seemed to froth with blue light.
And a confused noise of crackling, snapping and hissing
arose from it.</p>
<p>Every eye but Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s was glued in fascination to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
the baleful scene. But Gr&ocirc;m now thought only of
using that pervasive light to best advantage while it
should last. The wall of the cavern at this point was
so broken and fissured that it was not unscalable;
and a little way off to the right he marked, at some
height above the water, what looked like the entrance
to a lateral gallery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come! While the light lasts,&#8221; he ordered, setting
off over the rocks. The others followed close. Now
sidling along knife-like ledges, now clinging by fingers
and toes to almost imperceptible projections, they made
their way across the face of the steep, and gained the
mouth of the gallery. It was spacious, and easy to
traverse, its floor sloping upwards somewhat steeply.
They plunged into it with confidence. And the blue
light of the Hall of Terrors faded out behind them.</p>
<p>Not many minutes later, another light, as it were a
white star, gleamed ahead of them. It grew as they
went, and turned to gold. Then a patch of turquoise
sky, flecked sweetly with small fleeces of cloud, opened
before them, and in a moment more they came out
upon a high, blossoming down, blown over by a
breeze that smelt of honey and salt. Below them was
a lovely, land-locked bay, with a herd of deer pasturing
among scattered trees by the shore. Away behind
them undulated the gracious line of the downs, inviting
their feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a pleasant land,&#8221; said Gr&ocirc;m, &#8220;and we will
surely come back to it. But I think we must find another
way than that by which we came.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>THE FEASTING OF THE CAVE FOLK</h3>
</div>
<p style='text-align:center;'>I</p>
<p>At last, and reluctantly, the Folk of the Caves had
withdrawn from their earthquake-harassed
valley and betaken themselves to the new dwelling-place
which Gr&ocirc;m had found for them, on the green
hill-slope beside the Bitter Waters. They had lost
no time, however, in accepting the new conditions; for
these caves in the limestone were ample and secure&ndash;&ndash;it
was hard for any invader to come at them save by
way of the long, bare ridge of the downs running
westward behind the caves; a sweet-water brook ran
almost past their threshold to fall with a pleasant
clamor into the bay,&ndash;&ndash;and the surrounding country
was rich in game. The vast basin of marshy plain
and colossal jungle, to be sure, which stretched and
steamed below the downs to southward, was the habitation
of strange monsters; but these, apparently, had
no taste for exploring the high, clean, windy downs.</p>
<p>On a certain golden morning it chanced that the
caves were well-nigh deserted. The men of the tribe,
including the chiefs themselves, Bawr and Gr&ocirc;m, together
with most of the women and the half-grown
children, had gone off down the shore to a shallow
inlet five or six miles distant to gather shell-fish&ndash;&ndash;great
luscious mussels and peculiarly plump and savory
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
whelks. The girl A-ya, absorbed in her special occupation
of fashioning bows and arrows for the tribe,
had remained, with a half-score of old men and women
and Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s giant slave, the lame Bow-leg, Ook-ootsk,
to guard the little children and the tribal fires. As
Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s mate, and his confidential associate in all his
greatest ventures, A-ya&#8217;s prestige in the tribe had come
to be only less than that of Bawr and Gr&ocirc;m themselves.</p>
<p>On the open, grassy level before the cave mouth,
the two great fires burned steadily in the sun. The
giant Ook-ootsk, hideous with his ape-like forehead,
his upturned, flaring nostrils, his protruding jaw, his
shaggy, clay-colored torso, and his short, massive,
grotesquely bowed legs&ndash;&ndash;of which one was twisted so
that the toes pointed almost backwards&ndash;&ndash;lay sprawling
and chuckling benevolently near the entrance, while a
swarm of little ones, A-ya&#8217;s two among them,
clambered over him. The old men and the old women
most of them dozed in the shade, save two or three of
the most diligent, who occupied their gnarled fingers
in twisting thin strips of hide into bow-strings, or
lashing slivers of stone into the heads of spears.
A-ya sat cross-legged a little apart, beside a tiny fire,
laboriously fashioning her bows and arrows by charring
the wood in the embers and then rubbing it
between two rough stones. With her head bent low
over her work, the heavy, tangled masses of her hair
fell upon it and got in her way, and from time to time
she shook them aside impatiently. It was a picture
of primeval peace.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></p>
<p>But peace, in the days when earth was young, was
something more precarious than a bubble.</p>
<p>From around the green shoulder of the hill came a
sound of trampling hooves and labored breathing.
A-ya sprang to her feet, snatching up her own well-tried
bow and fitting an arrow to the string. At the
same time she gave a sharp alarm-cry, at which the
lame slave, Ook-ootsk, arose, shaking off the swarm of
children, and came hobbling towards her with his
weapons in both hands. An old woman pounced
upon the startled, wide-eyed children, and in a twinkling
had them shepherded into the cave-mouth, out of
sight. The old men, springing from their sleep, and
blinking, hurried forth into the sunlight, with such
spears or clubs as they could lay instant hand upon.</p>
<p>A breathless moment, while all stood waiting for
they knew not what. Then around the corner appeared
a tall, wide-antlered elk, its eyes showing the
whites with terror, its dilated nostrils spattering bloody
froth. A long, raking wound ran scarlet down one
flank. Staggering from weariness or loss of blood,
it came on straight toward the cave-mouth, so blinded
by its terror that it seemed not to see the human creatures
awaiting it, or even the fires before them.</p>
<p>A-ya fetched a deep breath of relief when she saw
that this was no ravening monster. Her immediate
thought was the hunter&#8217;s thought. She drew her bow
to the full length of her shaft, and as the panting
beast went by she let drive. The arrow pierced to
half its span, just behind the straining fore-shoulder.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
Blood burst from the animal&#8217;s nostrils. It fell on its
knees, struggled up again, blundered on for half a
dozen strides, and dropped half-way across the second
fire.</p>
<p>There was a chorus of triumphant shouts from the
old men and women; and A-ya started forward with
the intention of dragging her prize from the fire.
But a look of apprehension and warning in the keen
little eyes of Ook-ootsk, who had by this time hobbled
to her side, checked her. In a flash the meaning of it
came to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you suppose was chasing it, Ook-ootsk?&#8221;
she queried; and whipped about, without waiting for
his answer, to stare anxiously at the green shoulder
of the hillside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black lion, maybe,&#8221; said Ook-ootsk, in his harsh,
clucking voice, dropping his spear and club beside him
and setting a long arrow to the string of his massive
bow.</p>
<p>But the words were hardly out of his throat, when
his guess was proved wrong. Around the turn came
lumbering, with huge heads hung low and slavering,
half-open jaws a pair of those colossal red bears of
the caves which had always been A-ya&#8217;s peculiar terror.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hide the children!&#8221; she yelled, and then let fly an
arrow, almost without aim, at the foremost of the
monsters. She was the best shot in the tribe, and the
shaft sped even too true. It struck the bear full in
the snout, and pierced through the palate and into the
throat&ndash;&ndash;a wound which, though likely to prove mortal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
after a time, only made the beast more dangerous for
the moment. It paused, coughing, and tried to paw
the torment from its jaws, and then rushed forward,
screaming hideously.</p>
<p>In that pause, however, though it was but for a
second or two, the second bear had forged ahead of
its companion. It was greeted instantly by an arrow
from the massive bow of Ook-ootsk, aimed with cool
deliberation. The long shaft of hickory, delivered
thus at close range, caught the enemy in the front of
the right shoulder and drove clean in to the joint, so
that the leg gave way and the gigantic brute almost fell
upon its side. With a roar, it bit off the protruding
half of the tough hickory, and then came on again, on
three legs. From A-ya&#8217;s nimble bow it got another
arrow, which went half-way through its neck; but to
this deadly wound, which sent the blood gushing from
its mouth, it seemed to pay no heed whatever. A-ya&#8217;s
next shot missed; and then, screaming for the old
men to come into the fray, she snatched up her stone-headed
spear and ran around behind the nearest fire,
expecting the bears to follow her and be led away from
the hiding-place of the children.</p>
<p>But she had forgotten that the slave, Ook-ootsk,
with his twisted and shrunken leg, could not run.
That valiant savage, blinking his little eyes rapidly and
blowing defiantly through his upturned nostrils as he
saw his doom rushing upon him, let drive one more of
his long shafts into the red, towering bulk, then dropped
his bow, sank upon one knee, and held up his spear
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
slantingly before him, with its butt firmly braced upon
the ground. As the monster reared itself and fell upon
him, the jagged point of the spear was forced deep
into its belly, straight up till it reached the backbone.
Then the shaft snapped, Ook-ootsk sprawled forward
upon his face, and the monster, in the paroxysm of its
amazement and agony, leapt onward and plunged right
over him, involuntarily hurling him aside and clawing
most of the flesh off his back with a kick of one
gigantic hind paw.</p>
<p>He clenched his teeth stoically, shut his eyes, folded
his long, hairy arms about his head, and rolled himself
into a ball, confidently expecting in the next
moment to feel the life crunched out of him.</p>
<p>But just as the monster, recovering itself, was turning
madly to finish off its insignificant but torturing
opponent, A-ya came leaping back to the rescue, with
a blazing and sparkling faggot in each hand, and the
old men, some with fire-brands, some with spears,
clamoring resolutely behind her. With fearless
dexterity, she thrust the fire straight into the monster&#8217;s
eyeballs, totally blinding him. As he wheeled to strike
her down, she slipped aside with a mocking laugh, and
threw one of the brands between his jaws, where he
crunched upon it savagely before he felt the torment
of it and spat it out.</p>
<p>Depending now upon his ears, the monster blundered
straight forward in the direction of the shouting voices.
He had quite forgotten Ook-ootsk. He raged to
come at this last intolerable foe, who had scorched
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
the light from his eyes. He made for her voice
straight enough; but it chanced that exactly in his
path lay the second fire&ndash;&ndash;that into which the body of
the elk had fallen. Already too maddened with the
anguish of his wounds to notice the fire at once, he
stumbled upon the body. Here, surely, was one of
his foes. He fell to rending the carcase with his claws,
and biting it, crawling forward upon it to reach its
throat with the fire licking up derisively about his
head; till at length the flames were drawn deep into
his laboring lungs, searing them and sealing them so
that they could no more perform their office. With a
shallow, screeching gasp he threw himself backwards
out of the fire, rolled upon the turf, and lay there
fighting the air with his paws as he strangled swiftly
and convulsively.</p>
<p>The second bear, meanwhile, wallowing with astonishing
nimbleness on three legs, had charged roaring
into the group of old men. In a twinkling he had
three or four spears sticking into him; but the arms
that hurled the spears were weak, and the monster
ramped on unheeding. Several fire-brands fell upon
him, scorching his long, red fur, but he shook them off,
too maddened to remember his natural dread of the
flames.</p>
<p>The group scattered in all directions. But one brave
old gray-beard, who had marked A-ya&#8217;s success,
lingered in the path, and tried to thrust his blazing
faggot into the monster&#8217;s eyes, as she had done. He
was not quick enough. The monster threw up its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
muzzle, dodging the stroke, and the next moment it
had struck down its feeble adversary and crushed his
head between its tremendous jaws.</p>
<p>In its folly, it now forgot its other enemies, and fell
to wreaking its madness on the lifeless victim. But
in another second or two it was fairly overwhelmed
with the red brands descending upon its head. A-ya,
with all the force of her strong young arms, drove
her short spear half-way through its loins. Then, with
one eye blinded and its long fur smouldering, its rage
gave way suddenly into panic. Lifting its giant head
high into the air, as if thus to escape its fiery assailants,
it turned and scuttled back the way it had
come, while the old men swarmed after it, belaboring
and jabbing its elephantine rump with their live brands.</p>
<p>A-ya, racing like a deer and screaming with exultation,
ran round the pack of old men and stabbed the
frantic brute in the neck, with her spear held short
in both hands. Shrinking abjectly from this attack,
he swerved off toward the left. It was his left eye
that was blinded, and the other was full of smoke and
ashes. He missed the path, therefore, and plunged
squalling over the edge of the bluff, which at this
point dropped about a hundred feet, almost perpendicularly,
to the beach. Rolling over and over, and bouncing
out into space every time he struck the cliff face
he fell to the bottom amid a shower of stones and dust,
and lay there as shapeless as a fur rug dropped from
an upper window.</p>
<p>The old men, jabbering in triumph, craned their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
shaggy gray heads out over the brink to grin down
upon him, while A-ya, with a wild light in her eyes
and her strong white teeth gleaming savagely, turned
back to tend the wounds of her slave, Ook-ootsk.</p>
<p style='text-align:center;margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1em;'>II</p>
<p>Having assured herself that the hurts of Ook-ootsk,
dreadful though they were, were yet not
mortal (our sires of Cave and Tree took a lot of
killing!), A-ya stepped over to the further fire to see
about rescuing the carcase of the slain elk before it
should be quite burned up. As a matter of fact,
there was little of it actually consumed by the fire,
but it was amazingly shredded by the clawing of the
blinded bear; and an odor of roasted venison steamed
up from it, which seemed rather pleasant to A-ya&#8217;s
nostrils. Under her direction, the old men hauled
the body from the fire by the hind-legs, and dragged
it over to the edge of the bluff before cutting it up,
for convenience in getting rid of the offal. Every
one followed, to secure their due share of the tit-bits,
except Ook-ootsk and one old woman. This old
woman sat rocking and keening beside the body of her
mate whom the bear had slain; while Ook-ootsk
crawled off into a neighboring hollow to look for
certain healing herbs which should cleanse and astringe
his wounds.</p>
<p>The hide of the elk was too much burnt, too ripped
and torn by the claws of the bear, to be of any use
except for thongs; but the old men skinned it off
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
expertly before dividing the flesh. Though their
gnarled fingers were feeble, they were amazingly clever
in the use of the sharp-edged flakes of stone which
served them as knives. A-ya stood by them, watching
closely, to see that none of the specially dainty
cuts were appropriated. These delicacies were reserved
for herself and her two children, and for Gr&ocirc;m
when he should return. She had the right to them,
not only because she was the mate of Gr&ocirc;m, but because
the kill was hers.</p>
<p>As she stood over the carcase&ndash;&ndash;the fore-part of
which had been superficially barbecued in the fire&ndash;&ndash;the
smell of the roasted flesh began to appeal to her
even more strongly than at first. As she sniffed it,
curiously, it began to entice her appetite as nothing had
ever tempted it before. She touched a well-browned,
fatty morsel, and then put her fingers into her mouth.
The flavor seemed to her as delightful as the smell.
She cast about for a suitable morsel on which to
experiment.</p>
<p>Now it chanced that the elk&#8217;s tongue, having lain
in the heart of the fire, but enclosed within the half-open
jaws, had been cooked to a turn. A-ya possessed
herself of this ever-coveted delicacy. It looked so
queer, in its cooked state, charred black along the lower
edge, that she hesitated to taste it. At last, persuaded
by its fragrance, she brought herself to nibble at it.</p>
<p>A moment more and she was devouring it with a
gusto which, had manners been greatly considered in
the days when the earth was young, might have seemed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
unbecoming in the wife of a great chief. Never before
had she eaten anything that seemed to her half so
delicious. It was the food she had all her life been
craving. Her two little boys, pulling at her, aroused
her from her ecstasy. She gave them each a fragment,
which they swallowed greedily, demanding more;
and between the three of them the great lump of roast
tongue quickly vanished.</p>
<p>The rest of the crowd meanwhile had been looking
on with instinctive disapproval. The portions of the
meat which the fire had cooked, or partly cooked,
seemed to them spoiled. A-ya might, indeed, like the
strange food; but she was different from the rest of
them in so many ways! When, however, they saw
her two boys follow her example, and noted their enthusiasm,
several of the old men ventured to try for
themselves. They were instant converts. Last of all,
the old women and the children&ndash;&ndash;always the most conservative
in such matters, took the notion that they
were losing something, and dared to essay the novel
diet. One taste, as a rule, proved enough to vanquish
their prejudices. In a very few minutes every shred
of the carcase that could claim acquaintance with the
fire had been eaten, and all were clamoring for more.
Fully three-parts of the carcase remained, indeed, but
it was all raw flesh. A-ya looked down upon it with
disdain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take it back and throw it on the fire again!&#8221; she
ordered angrily. The generous lump of steak, which
she had hacked off for herself from the loin, had proved
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
to be merely scorched on the outside, and she was disappointed.
She stood fingering the raw mass with resentful
aversion, while the old men and women, chattering
gleefully and followed by the horde of children
dragged the mangled carcase back to the fire, lifted it
laboriously by all four legs, and managed to deposit it
in the very midst of the flames. A shrill shout of
triumph went up from the withered old throats at this
achievement, and they all drew back to wait for the
fire to do its wonderful work.</p>
<p>But A-ya was impatient, and vaguely dissatisfied
as she watched that crude roasting in the process. She
stood brooding, eyeing the fire and turning her lump
of raw flesh over and over in her hands. The attitude
of body was one she had caught from Gr&ocirc;m, when he
was groping for a solution to some problem. And
now it seemed as if she had caught his attitude of mind
as well. Into her brain, for the moment passive and
receptive, flashed an idea, she knew not whence. It
was as if it had been whispered to her. She picked
up a spear, jabbed its stone head firmly into the lump
of meat, and thrust the meat into the edge of the
fire, as far as it could go without burning the wood
of the spear shaft.</p>
<p>It took her a very few minutes to realize that her
idea was nothing less than an inspiration. Moving the
morsel backwards and forwards to keep it from charring,
she found that it seemed to do best over a mass
of hot coals rather than in a flame; and being a thin
cut, it cooked quickly. When it was done she burnt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
her fingers with it, and her big red mouth as well; and
her two boys, for whom she had torn off shreds too
hot for herself to hold, danced up and down and wept
loudly with the smart of it, to be instantly consoled by
the savor.</p>
<p>Noting the supreme success of A-ya&#8217;s experiment,
the spectators rushed in, dragged the carcase once more
from the fire, and fell to hacking off suitable morsels,
each for himself. In a few minutes every one who
could get hold of a long arrow, or a spear, or a pointed
stick, was busy learning to cook. Even the wailing
old mourner, finding the excitement irresistible, forsook
the body of her slain mate and came forward to take
her share. Only the dead man, lying outstretched in
the sun by the cave-door, and the crippled giant Ook-ootsk,
away in the green hollow nursing his honorable
wounds, had no part in the rejoicing, in this revel
of the First Cooked Food. The hot meat juices,
modified by the action of the fire, were almost as
stimulating as alcohol in the veins of these simple
livers, and the revel grew to something like an orgie
as the shriveled nerves of the elders began to thrill
with new life. A-ya, seeing the carcase of the elk
melt away like new snow under a spring sun, gave
orders to skin and cut up the body of the first bear.</p>
<p>But the old men were too absorbed in their feasting
to pay any attention to her orders; and she herself
was too exhilarated and content to make any serious
effort to enforce them. Every one, old and young
alike, was sucking burnt fingers and radiating greasy,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
happy smiles, and she felt dimly that anything like
discipline would be unpopular at such a moment.</p>
<p>During all this excitement the main body of the
tribe came straggling back along the beach from their
hunting of whelks and mussels. At the foot of the
bluff below the cave they found the body of the second
bear, and gathered anxiously about it, clamoring over
its spear-wounds and the arrows sticking in it, till Bawr
and Gr&ocirc;m, who were in the rear, came up. It was
plain there had been a terrific battle at the Cave. With
most of the warriors the two Chiefs dashed on and up
the path, to find out how things had gone, while a
handful remained behind to skin the bear and cut up
the meat.</p>
<p>When the anxious warriors arrived before the cave,
they were amazed at the hilarity which they found
there&ndash;&ndash;and inclined, at first, to resent it, being something
to which they had no clue. What were all
the old fools doing, dancing and cackling about the
fire, and wasting good meat by poking it into the fire
on the ends of sticks and spears and arrows?</p>
<p>The younger women, coming up behind the warriors,
were derisive. They were always critical in their attitude
towards A-ya&ndash;&ndash;so far as they dared to be&ndash;&ndash;and
now they ran forward to scold and slap their respective
children for putting this disgusting burnt meat
into their mouths.</p>
<p>To Gr&ocirc;m and Bawr, however, A-ya explained the
whole situation in a few pertinent phrases, and followed
up her explanation by proffering them each a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
well-cooked morsel. They both smelled it doubtfully,
tasted it, broke into smiles, and devoured it, smacking
their bearded lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did <i>you</i> do this, girl?&#8221; demanded Gr&ocirc;m, beaming
upon her proudly and holding out his great hairy hand
for another sample. But Bawr strode forward, thrust
the old men aside, hacked himself off a generous collop,
stuck it on his spear-head, and thrust it into the fire.</p>
<p>In his impatience, Bawr kept pulling the roast out
every minute or two, to taste it and see if it was done
enough. His enthusiasm&ndash;&ndash;and that of Gr&ocirc;m, who was
now following his example&ndash;&ndash;cured the rest of the
warriors of their hesitation, so effectually that in five
minutes there was nothing more left of the great elk&#8217;s
carcase but antlers, bone and offal. Those who had
got nothing fell upon the body of the bear, skinning
it and hacking it in greedy haste. The young women,
having satisfied convention by slapping their bewildered
and protesting brats, soon yielded to curiosity and
began surreptitiously to nibble at the greasy cooked
morsels which they had confiscated. Then they, too,
grabbed up spears and sticks for toasting-forks and
came clamoring shrilly for their portions. And A-ya,
standing a little apart with Gr&ocirc;m, smiled with comprehending
sarcasm at their conversion.</p>
<p>For the next few hours the fires were surrounded
each by a seething and squabbling mob, the innermost
rings engaged in toasting their collops with one hand,
while with the other they tried to shield their faces
from the heat. As fast as those in the front rank wriggled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
out with their browned and juicy tit-bits, others
battled in to take their places; and the Tribe of the
Cave Men, mindful of nothing but the gratification of
this new taste, feasted away the afternoon with such
unanimous and improvident rejoicing as they had never
known before. At last, radiant with gravy and repletion,
they flung themselves down where they would
and went to sleep, Bawr and Gr&ocirc;m, and two or three
others of the older warriors, who had been wise enough
to banquet without gorging themselves, thought with
some misgiving of what might happen if an enemy
should steal upon them at such an hour of torpor.</p>
<p>But no enemy approached. With the fall of the dew
the moon arose over the bay, honey-colored in a violet
sky, and played fantastic tricks with the shifting light
of the fires. And from within the cave came softly
the voice of A-ya, soothing a restless child.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS</h3>
</div>
<p style='text-align:center;'>I</p>
<p>The People of the Cave were running short of
arrows. The supply of young hickory sprouts,
on which they had depended for their shafts, was almost
exhausted. And within a two days&#8217; journey of
the Caves there was nothing to be found that would
quite take the place of those hickory sprouts. Neither
Gr&ocirc;m himself nor any other member of his tribe had
as yet succeeded in so fixing a tip of bone or flint to a
shaft of cane as not to interfere with its penetration.
Some growth must be found that was tough, perfectly
straight, and tapering, while at the same time so solid
and hard of grain that it would take and hold a point,
and heavy enough for driving power. All this was
difficult to find, and Gr&ocirc;m was convinced that it must
be sought for far afield. Life had been running uneventfully
for months at the Great Caves, and Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s
restless spirit was craving new knowledge, new adventure.</p>
<p>On this quest of the arrow Gr&ocirc;m took with him only
two companions&ndash;&ndash;his slim, swift-footed mate, A-ya
and that cunning little scout, Loob, the Hairy One.</p>
<p>For the space of three days they journeyed due west
from the Caves. Then the range of downland which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
they had been following swept off sharply to the south.</p>
<p>Being bent upon exploring to the westward&ndash;&ndash;though
he was not very clear as to his reasons for his preference&ndash;&ndash;Gr&ocirc;m
led the way down from the hills into the
rankly wooded plain. For two days more they pushed
on through incessant perils, the country swarming
with black lions, saber-tooth, and woolly rhinoceros.
As they were not fighting, but exploring, the price of
safety was a vigilance so unremitting that it soon began
to get on their nerves, and they were glad to take a
whole day&#8217;s rest in the spacious security of a banyan
top, where nothing could come at them but leopards or
pythons. Neither leopards nor pythons gave them any
great concern.</p>
<p>On the second day after quitting their refuge in
the banyan top, they emerged from the jungle so
suddenly that they nearly fell into a river, whose
whitish, turbid flood ran swirling heavily before their
feet. It was a mighty stream, a good half-mile in
width, and at this point the current was eating away
the bank so hungrily that whole ranks of tree and
bush had toppled over into the tide.</p>
<p>The great river barred their way, flowing as it did
toward the north-east, and Gr&ocirc;m reluctantly turned
the course of the expedition southward, following up
the shore. Swift as was the current, these folk of the
Caves might have crossed it by swimming; but Gr&ocirc;m
knew that such waters were apt to swarm with giant
crocodiles of varying type and unvarying ferocity, as
well as with ferocious flesh-eating fish that swarmed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
in wolfish packs, and were able to tear an aurochs or
a mastodon in pieces with their razor-edged teeth. He
gazed desirously at the opposite shore, however&ndash;&ndash;which
looked to him much more beautiful and more
interesting than that on which he stood&ndash;&ndash;and wondered
if he should ever be able to devise some way of
reaching it other than by swimming.</p>
<p>Along the river shore the travelers had endless
variety to keep them interested, with a less exhausting
imminence of peril than in the depths of the
jungle. Sometimes great branches, draped and festooned
with gorgeous-flowered lianas, thrust themselves
far out over the water, affording easy refuge.
Sometimes the river was bordered by a strip of grassy
level, behind which ran the edge of the jungle in the
form of a steep bank of violent green, with here and
there a broad splotch of magenta or violet or orange
bloom flung over it like a curtain. At times, again,
it was necessary to plunge back into the humming and
steaming gloom behind this resplendent screen, in order
to make a d&eacute;tour around some swampy cove, whose
dense growth of sedge, fifteen to twenty feet in height,
was traversed by wide trails which showed it to be
the abode of unfamiliar monsters. The travelers were
curious as to the makers of such colossal trails, but
were not tempted to gratify this curiosity by invading
their lairs.</p>
<p>In all this time, and through all difficulties and
dangers, neither Gr&ocirc;m nor A-ya, nor the unsleeping
Loob had lost sight of the object of their journey.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
Every straight and slender sapling and seedling of
hard grain they tested, but hitherto they had found
nothing that came within measurable distance of their
requirements.</p>
<p>In the customary order of their going, Gr&ocirc;m went
first, peering ahead, ever studying, pondering, observing,
with his bow and his club swung from his
shoulder, his heavy, flint-headed spear always in readiness
for use at close quarters. Loob the scout, little
and dark and hairy, with the eyes of a weasel and the
heart of a bull buffalo, went darting and gliding soundlessly
through the undergrowth a few paces to the left,
guarding against the approach of any attack from the
jungle-depths. While A-ya, whose quickness and precision
with the bow, her darling weapon, were nothing
less than a miracle to all the tribe, covered the rear,
lest any prowling monster should be following on
their trail.</p>
<p>It chanced that A-ya dropped back some paces
further, without saying anything to Gr&ocirc;m. She had
marked a slim shaft of a seedling which looked suitable
for an arrow; and in case the discovery should
prove a good one, she wanted the credit of it to herself.
She stooped to pull the seedling up by the roots,
since it seemed too tough to break. It was obstinate.
In the effort her naked side and shoulder leaned fully
against the trunk of a small tree of which she had
taken no notice. In a second it seemed to her as if
the tree trunk were made of red-hot coals. The stinging
fire of it ran like lightning all over her arms
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
and body. With a piercing scream she sprang away
from the tree, and began tearing and beating frantically
at her body with both hands. She was covered
with furious ants&ndash;&ndash;the great, red, stinging ants whose
venom is like drops of liquid flame.</p>
<p>At the sound of her scream, Gr&ocirc;m was back at
her side in two leaps, his hair and beard bristling
stiffly, his eyes blazing with rage. But there was no
assailant in sight on whom to hurl himself. For a
second or two he glared about him wildly, with Loob
crouched beside him, snarling for vengeance. Then,
perceiving the woman&#8217;s plight, he flung himself upon
her, trying to envelop her in one sweeping embrace that
should crush all the virulent pests at once. In this
he failed signally; and in an instant the liquid fire was
running over his own body. The torture of it, however,
was a small thing to him compared with the
torture of seeing them sting the woman, and feeling
himself impotent to effect her instant succor. He
slapped and beat at her with his great hands, while she
covered her face with her own hands to protect it from
disfigurement.</p>
<p>Loob came to help, but Gr&ocirc;m, his brain keen in
every emergency, stopped him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep off!&#8221; he ordered. &#8220;Keep off! and keep
watch!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he seized A-ya by one arm, rushed her to the
edge of the bank, and dragged her with him into the
water.</p>
<p>At this point the water was not much more than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
three feet deep. They crouched down in it, heads
under, for nearly a minute; while Loob, spear in hand,
stood over them, his wild little eyes scanning the water
depths in front and the jungle depths behind for the
approach of any foe.</p>
<p>When they could hold their breath no longer, they
stood up. Their red assailants were floating off on
the current; but the fiery poison remained, and they
bathed each other&#8217;s scarlet and scorched shoulders assiduously,
forgetful for the moment of everything
besides. At this moment a gigantic water python
reared its head from the leafage close by, fixed its
flat, lidless, glittering eyes upon them, and drew back
to strike. But in the next second Loob&#8217;s ready spear
was thrust clean through its throat, and his yell of
warning tore the air. Gr&ocirc;m and A-ya whipped up onto
the bank like a pair of otters: and the python,
mortally stricken, shot out into the water over their
heads, carrying Loob&#8217;s spear with it, gripped tight in
the constriction of its throat muscles.</p>
<p>As the lashing body struck the surface the water
boiled about it, suddenly alive with crocodiles.
Balked of their human prey, they fell upon the python.
One of the monsters shot straight up, half-way out of
the water, with two convulsive coils of the python&#8217;s
tail wrapped crushingly about its jaws; but the python,
with Loob&#8217;s spear through its throat, could only
struggle blindly. A moment more and it was bitten
in two, and the crocodiles were fighting monstrously
among themselves for the writhing fragments.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You got us out of that just in time,&#8221; said Gr&ocirc;m,
grinning upon the little scout with approval.</p>
<p>A-ya wrung the water out of her heavy hair with
both hands, and threw the masses back with an upward
toss of her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate ants,&#8221; she said, shuddering. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get
away from here.&#8221;</p>
<p style='text-align:center;margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1em;'>II</p>
<p>Some two hours after sunrise of the following day
they came to a place where a belt of woods,
perhaps a hundred to two hundred yards in depth, ran
bordering the river, while behind it a broad stretch of
grassy plain thrust back the jungle. Along the edge
of the plain, skirting the belt of woods, the grass was
short and the traveling was easy; but off to the left
the growth was ranker, and interspersed with thickets
such as Gr&ocirc;m always regarded with suspicion. He
had learned by experience that these dense thickets in
the grass-land were a favorite lurking-place of the
unexpected&ndash;&ndash;and that the unexpected was almost always
perilous.</p>
<p>Suddenly from the deeper grass a couple of hundred
yards or so to the left rose heavily the menacing bulk
of a red Siva moose bull, and stood staring at them
with mingled wonder and malevolence in his cruelly
vindictive eyes. In stature surpassing the biggest
rhinoceros that Gr&ocirc;m had ever seen, he gave the impression
of combining the terrific power of the
rhinoceros with the agile speed and devilish cunning of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
the buffalo. His ponderous head, with its high-arched
eagle-hooked snout, was armed with two pairs of
massive, keen-tipped, broad-bladed horns, that seemed
to be a deadly-efficient compromise between the horns
of a buffalo and the palmated antlers of a moose.
This alarming apparition snorted loudly, and at once
from behind him lurched to their feet some two score
more of his like, and all stood with their eyes fixed upon
the little group of travelers by the edge of the wood.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m had heard vague traditions of the implacable
ferocity of these red monsters, but having before
never come across them he answered their stare with
keen interest. At the same time, edging in closer to
the wood, he whispered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t run. But if they come we must go up the
first tree. They are swift as the wind, these great
beasts, and more terrible than the saber-tooth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t go in <i>these</i> trees!&#8221; said Loob, whose piercing
eyes had investigated them minutely at the first glimpse
of the monsters in the grass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; demanded Gr&ocirc;m, his eyes still fixed
upon the monsters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! The bees! The terrible bees!&#8221; whispered
A-ya. &#8220;Where can we go?&#8221;</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m turned his head and scanned the belt of woodland,
his ears now suddenly comprehending a deep,
humming sound which he had hitherto referred solely
to the winged foragers in the grass-tops. Scattered
at intervals from the branches, in the shadowy green
gloom, hung a number of immense, dark, semi-pear-shaped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
globes. They looked harmless enough, but
Gr&ocirc;m knew that their inhabitants, the great jungle-bees,
were more to be dreaded than saber-tooth or
crocodile. To disturb, or seem to threaten to disturb,
one of their nests, meant sure and instant doom.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we must trust to our running&ndash;&ndash;and they are
very swift,&#8221; said Gr&ocirc;m. &#8220;But let us go softly now,
and perhaps they will not charge upon us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The words were hardly out of his mouth when the
giant red bull, with a grunt of wrath, lurched forward
and charged down at them. And instantly the whole
herd, with their ridiculous little tails stuck up stiffly
in the air, charged after him. Swift as thought A-ya
drew her bow. The arrow buried itself deep in the
red giant&#8217;s muzzle. With a bawl of fury, he paused,
to try and root the burning torment out of his nose.
The whole herd paused behind him. It was only for a
few seconds, and then he came on again, blowing
blood and foam from his nostrils; but they were
precious seconds, and the fugitives, running lightly,
and stooping low for fear of offending the bees, had
gained a start of a hundred yards or more.</p>
<p>The three were among the swiftest runners of the
tribe; but Gr&ocirc;m soon saw that the utmost they could
hope was to maintain their distance. And there was
the imminent risk that the bees, disturbed by the noise
of flight and pursuit, might take umbrage. To lessen
this frightful risk, he swerved out till he was some
thirty or forty paces distant from the belt of woods.
And he noticed, too, that the pursuing herd seemed to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
have no great anxiety to approach the frontiers of the
Bee People. They were following on a slant that
gave the woods a wide berth.</p>
<p>About a mile further on the woods came to an
end, and Gr&ocirc;m, though he feared the pace might be
beginning to tell on A-ya, and though there was no
refuge in sight, breathed more freely. He feared the
bees more than the yellow monsters, because they were
something he could not fight. The grass-land now ran
clear to the river&#8217;s edge, and gave firm footing; and
the fugitives raced on, breathing carefully, and trusting
to come to trees again before they should be spent.</p>
<p>At last a curve of the bank showed them the woods
sweeping down again to the water, but three or four
miles ahead! Gr&ocirc;m, looking back over his shoulder,
realized that their pursuers were now gaining upon
them appreciably. With an effort he quickened his
pace still further. Loob responded without difficulty.
But A-ya&#8217;s face showed signs of distress, and at this
Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s heart sank. He began to scan the water,
weighing the chances of the crocodiles. It looked as
if they were trapped beyond escape.</p>
<p>Perhaps half a mile up the shore a spit of land
ran out against the current, and behind its shelter an
eddy had collected a mass of uprooted trees and other
flood refuse, all matted with green from the growth
of wind-borne seeds. It was in reality a great natural
raft, built by the eddy and anchored behind the little
point. For this Gr&ocirc;m headed with new hope. It
might be strong enough&ndash;&ndash;parts of it at least&ndash;&ndash;to bear
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
up the three fugitives. But their furious pursuers
would surely not venture their giant bulks upon it.</p>
<p>Approaching the point he slackened his pace, and
steadied A-ya with one hand. At the edge of the eddy
he stopped, casting an appraising eye over the collection
of d&eacute;bris, in order to pick out a stable retreat and
also the most secure path to it. In this pause the
monsters swept up with a thunder of trampling hooves
and windy snortings. They had their victims at last
where there was no escape.</p>
<p>The raging brutes were not more than a dozen paces
behind, when Gr&ocirc;m led the way out upon the floating
mass, picking his steps warily and leaping from trunk
to trunk. Loob and A-ya followed with like care.
Certain of the trunks gave and sank beneath their
feet, but their feet were already away to surer footing.
And at the very outermost point of that old collection
of d&eacute;bris, where the current and the eddy wavered for
mastery, on a toughly interwoven tangle of uprooted
trunks and half-dead vines, they found a refuge which
did not yield beneath them. Here, steadying themselves
by upthrust branches, they turned and looked
back, half apprehensive and half defiant, at their mighty
pursuers.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll never dare to try to follow us here,&#8221; gasped
A-ya.</p>
<p>But she was wrong. Quite blind with rage through
that galling shaft in his muzzle, the giant bull came
plunging on, and half a dozen of his closest followers,
infected with his madness, came with him. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
inner edge of the mass gave way at once beneath them&ndash;&ndash;and
the bank at this point was straight up and down.
The monsters floundered in deep water, snorting and
spluttering, while their fellows on the shore checked
themselves violently and drew back bawling with bewilderment.
As the drowning monsters battled to
get their front legs up upon the raft, the edges gave
way continually beneath them, plunging them again
and again beneath the surface, while A-ya stabbed at
them vengefully with her spear, and Loob shot arrows
into them till Gr&ocirc;m stopped him, saying that the arrows
were too precious to waste. Thereupon Loob tripped
delicately over the surging trunks and smote at the
struggling monsters&#8217; heads with his light club.</p>
<p>The anchorage of this natural raft having been
broken, the weight of the monsters striving to gain
a foothold upon it soon thrust its firm outer portion
forth into the grip of the current. In a minute or two
more this solid portion was torn away from the rest,
and went sailing off slowly down stream with its
living freight. The incoherent remnant was left in
the eddy, where the snorting monsters struggled and
threshed about amongst it, now climbing half-way out
upon some great trunk, which forthwith reared on end
and slid them off, now vanishing for a moment beneath
the beaten stew of leaves and vines.</p>
<p>A couple of the horned giants, being close to the
bank, now seemed to recover their wits sufficiently to
turn and clamber ashore. But the others were mad
with terror. And in a moment more the fascinated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
watchers on the raft perceived the cause of this madness.
All round the scene of the turmoil the water
seethed with lashing tails and snapping jaws; and then
one of the monsters, which had struggled out into
clear water, was dragged down in a boiling vortex
of jaws and bloody foam. A few moments more and
the whole eddy became a bubbling hell of slaughter,
and great broad washes of crimson streamed out upon
the current. The monsters, for all their giant strength,
and the pile-driving blows of their huge hoofs, were
as helpless as rabbits against their swarming and
ravenous assailants; and the battle&ndash;&ndash;which indeed was
no battle at all&ndash;&ndash;soon was over. The eddy had become
but a writhing nest of crocodiles.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was hardly worth while wasting arrows, you
see?&#8221; said Gr&ocirc;m, standing erect on the raft and watching
the scene with brooding interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you suppose those swimming beasts with the
great jaws can get at us here?&#8221; demanded A-ya with
a shudder.</p>
<p>&#8220;While this thing that carries us holds together,
I think we can fight them off,&#8221; replied Gr&ocirc;m. And
straightway he set himself to examine how securely
the trees were interknit. The trunks had been piled
by flood one upon another, and the structure seemed
substantial; but to further strengthen it he set all to
work interweaving the free branches and such creepers
as the mass contained, with the skill that came of
much practice in the weaving of tree-top nests.</p>
<p>When all was done that could be done, the voyagers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
took time to look about them. They had by now been
swept far out into the river, and the shores on either
side seemed low and remote. A-ya felt oppressed,
the face of the waters seeming to her so vast, inscrutable
and menacing. She stole close up to Gr&ocirc;m
and edged herself under his massive arm for reassurance.
The little scout sat like a monkey between
two branches, and scratched his hairy arms, and, with
an expression of pleased interest, scanned the water
for the approach of new foes. As for Gr&ocirc;m, he was
entranced. This, at last, was what he had really come
in search of, the stuff for arrows being merely his
excuse to himself. This was the utterly new experience,
the new achievement. He was traveling by
water, not in it, but upon it&ndash;&ndash;upborne, dry and without
discomfort, upon its surface.</p>
<p>For a little while he did not ask whither he was being
borne. To his surprise the crocodiles and other
formidable water-dwellers, which were quite unknown
to him, paid them no attention whatever; and he concluded
that they looked upon the raft as nothing more
than a mass of floating driftwood containing nothing
for them to eat. He could see them everywhere about,
swimming with brute snouts half above water or basking
on sandy spits of shore. Then he observed that
the current was bearing them gradually towards that
further shore which he so longed to visit, and he
thrilled with new anticipation. But when, after
perhaps an hour, the capricious tide blew them again
to mid-stream, a new idea took possession of him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
He must find some way of influencing the direction
of their voyage. He could not long relinquish himself
to the blind whim and chance of the current.</p>
<p>Just as he was beginning to grapple with this
problem, A-ya anticipated his thought&ndash;&ndash;as he had
noticed that she often did. Looking up at him through
her tossed hair, she enquired where they were going.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am just trying to think,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;how to
make this thing take us where we want to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If the water is not too deep, couldn&#8217;t you push
with your long spear?&#8221; suggested the girl.</p>
<p>Acting at once on the suggestion, Gr&ocirc;m leaned over
the edge and thrust the spear straight downwards.
But he could find no bottom.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is too deep,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but I&#8217;ll find a way.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he stood near the forward end of the raft he
began sweeping the spear in a wide arc through the
water, as if it were a paddle, but with the idea merely
of testing the resistance of the water. Poor substitute
as the spear was for a paddle or an oar, his great
strength made up for its inefficiency, and after a few
sweeps he was astonished and delighted to notice that
the head of the raft had swung away from him, so
that it was heading for the shore from which they had
come.</p>
<p>He pondered this in silence for a little, then stepped
over to the other side and repeated the experiment.
After several vigorous efforts the unwieldy craft
yielded. Its head swung straight, and then, very
gradually, toward the other side. Yes, there was no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
doubt about it. He had found a way of influencing
their direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to take you over to the other shore,&#8221;
he announced proudly.</p>
<p>And now, laboring in a keen excitement, he set
himself to carry out his boast. First he so overdid
it that he made the raft turn clean about and head upstream.
He puzzled over this for a time, but at
length got it once more headed in the direction which he
wished it to take. Then he found that he could keep
it to this direction&ndash;&ndash;more or less&ndash;&ndash;by taking a few
strokes on one side, then hurriedly crossing to take a
few strokes on the other. And in this way they began
once more to approach the other bank. The process,
however, was slow; and Gr&ocirc;m presently concluded
that it was wasteful. He hit upon the idea of setting
A-ya and Loob together to stroking with their spears
on one side, while he, with his great strength, balanced
their effort on the other. Whereupon the sluggish
craft woke up a little and began to make perceptible
progress, on a slant across the current toward shore.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have found it!&#8221; he exclaimed in exultation. &#8220;On
this thing we can travel over the water where we will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But not against the current,&#8221; objected A-ya, whose
enthusiasm was a little damped by the fact that she did
not like the look of that further shore.</p>
<p>&#8220;That will come in time,&#8221; declared Gr&ocirc;m confidently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s something coming now,&#8221; announced Loob,
springing to his feet and grabbing his bow. At the
same moment the flat, villainous head of a big crocodile
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
shot up over the edge of the raft, and its owner, with
enormous jaws half open, started to scramble aboard.</p>
<p>A-ya&#8217;s bow was bent as swiftly as Loob&#8217;s, and the
two arrows sped together, both into the monster&#8217;s
gaping gullet. Amazed at this reception it shut its jaws
with a loud snap, halted and came on again. Then a
stab of Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s great spear caught it full in the eye,
and this wound struck fear into its dull mind. It rolled
back hastily into the water and sank, leaving a foamy
wake of blood behind it.</p>
<p>By this time they were getting nearer the other shore.
But on close view, Gr&ocirc;m was bound to admit that it
was not alluring. It was so low as to be all awash, and
fringed deep with towering reeds, which were traversed
by narrow lanes of water. Of dry land there was
none to be seen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we don&#8217;t want to go ashore there!&#8221; protested
A-ya fervently. As she spoke a hideous head, with
immense, round, bulging eyes and long, beak-like
mouth arose over the sedge tops on a long, swaying
neck and stared at them fixedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Gr&ocirc;m, with decision, making
haste to swing the head of the raft once more out into
the channel. They were pursued by a dense crowd
of mosquitoes, voracious and venomous, which followed
them to mid-stream and kept tormenting them
till an up-river gust blew them off.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m made up his mind that the exploration of that
unknown shore could wait a more convenient season.
He was now deeply absorbed in the complex problem
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
of directing and managing his raft. As he pulled his
spear through the water, and noted the additional effect
of its flat head, the conception came to him of something
that would get a more propulsive grip upon the
water than was possible to a round pole. Furthermore,
he was quick to realize that the immense, shapeless
mass of d&eacute;bris on which they were traveling might
be replaced by something light and manageable which
he would make by lashing some trimmed trunks together
with lengths of bamboo to give additional
buoyancy. As he brooded this in silence, with that
deep, inward look in his eyes which always kept A-ya
from breaking in upon his vision, he came to the idea
of a formal raft, and a formal paddle. And to this
he added, with a full sense of its value, A-ya&#8217;s suggestion
that this new structure might very well be pushed
along, in shallow water, with a pole. Having thought
this out, he drew a deep breath, looked up, and met
A-ya&#8217;s eyes with a smile. His eager desire now was
to get back home and put his new scheme into execution.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are we going now?&#8221; asked A-ya.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m looked about him wildly&ndash;&ndash;at the sky, at the
far-off hills on their right, at the course of the stream,
which had changed within the past few miles. His
sense of direction was unerring.</p>
<p>&#8220;This river,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;flows towards the rising
sun, and must empty into the bitter waters not more
than a day or a half day from the Caves. We are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
going home. We will come again to look for arrows
in a new raft which I will make.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he spoke, Loob&#8217;s spear darted down beside the
raft, and came up with a big, silvery fish writhing
upon it. He broke its neck with a blow and laid the
prize at A-ya&#8217;s feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish we had fire with us, to cook it with,&#8221; said
she.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the new raft, as I will make it,&#8221; said Gr&ocirc;m,
&#8220;that may very well be. Our journey will be safe and
easy, and the good fire we will have always with us.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE FEAR</h3>
</div>
<p>The People of the Caves were beginning to dread
their good fortune. Plenty was being showered
upon them with so lavish and sudden a hand that
they looked at it askance, distrustful of the unsought-for
largess. For a week or more their hunting-grounds
had been swarming with game, in amazing and
daily increasing numbers, till there was little more of
chance or of excitement in the hunt than in plucking
a ripe mango from its branch. It was game of the
choicest kinds, too&ndash;&ndash;deer of many varieties, and
antelope, and the little wild horse whose flesh they
accounted such a delicacy. They slew, and slew, and
their cooking-fires were busy night and day, and the
flesh they could not devour was dried in the sun in
long strips or smoked in the reek of green-wood fires.
They feasted greedily, but there was something sinister
in the whole matter, something ominous; and they
would stop at times to wonder anxiously what stroke
of fate could be hanging over the Caves.</p>
<p>During the past day or two, moreover, there had
been a disquieting influx of those great and fierce
beasts which the Cave Men were by no means anxious
to hunt. The giant white and the woolly rhinoceros
had arrived by the score in the dense thickets of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
steaming savannah which unrolled its green-and-yellow
breadths along the southward base of the downs.
These half-blind brutes appeared to be waging a dreadful
and doubtful war with the red herds of those monstrous,
cone-horned survivals from an earlier age, the
Arsinotheria, who had ruled the reeking savannah for
countless cycles. The roar and trampling of the
struggle came up from time to time to the dwellers in
the Caves, when the hot breeze came up from the southward.</p>
<p>What concerned the Cave Folk far more than any
near-sighted and blundering rhinoceros, however
malignant, was the sudden arrival of the great red
bears, the black lions, the grinning and implacable
saber-tooth tigers, and giant black-gray wolves which
hunted in small, handy packs of six or seven in number.
All these, the dread foes of Man for as long as tradition
could remember, had been mercifully few and
scattered. Now, in a night, they had become as
common as conies; and not a child could be allowed to
play beyond shelter of the cave-mouth fires, not a
woman durst venture to the spring without a brightly
blazing fire-brand in her hand. Yet&ndash;&ndash;and this seemed
to the Tribe the most portentous sign of all&ndash;&ndash;these
blood-thirsty beasts appeared to have lost much of
their ancient hostility to Man. They were all well
fed, of course, their accustomed prey being now so
abundant that they had little more to do than put forth
an armed paw and seize it. But they all seemed uneasy
and half-cowed, as if weighed down by a menace which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
they did not know how to face. When a man confronted
them, the fiercest of them made way with a
deprecating air, as if to say that they had troubles
enough on their minds.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Bawr, the Chief, and Gr&ocirc;m, his right hand and his
counselor, stood upon the bare green ridge above the
Cave-mouth, and stared down anxiously upon the sun-drenched
plain. Of old it had taken keen eyes to
discern the varied life which populated its bamboo-thickets
and cane-choked marshes. Now it was as
thronged as the home pastures of a cattle-farm. Here
and there a battle raged between such small-brained
brutes as the white rhinoceros and the cone-horned
monster; but for the most part there was an apprehensive
sort of truce, the different kinds of beasts keeping
as far as possible to themselves.</p>
<p>Further out in the plain pastured a herd of gigantic
creatures such as neither Bawr nor Gr&ocirc;m had ever
seen before. A pair of rhinoceros looked like pygmies
beside them. They were both tall and massive, of a
dark mud-color, with colossal heads, no necks whatever,
huge ears that flapped like wings, immensely long,
up-curving tusks of gleaming yellow&ndash;&ndash;mighty enough
to carry a bison cradled in their curve&ndash;&ndash;and it seemed
to the astonished watchers on the ridge that from the
snout of each monster grew a great snake, which reared
itself into the air, and waved terribly, and pulled down
the tops of trees for the monster&#8217;s food.</p>
<p>It was the Cave Man&#8217;s first view of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
Mammoth&ndash;&ndash;which had not yet developed the shaggy coat it
was later to grow on the cold sub-Artic plains.</p>
<p>Recovering at length from his amazement, Bawr
remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;They seem to have two tails, those new beasts&ndash;&ndash;a
little tail behind, in the usual place, and a very big
tail in front, which they use as a hand. They are
very many, and very terrible. Do you think it is they
who are driving all these other beasts upon us to
overwhelm us?&#8221;</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m thought long before replying.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said he, &#8220;they are not flesh-eaters. See!
They do not heed the other beasts. They eat trees.
And they, too, seem restless. I think they are themselves
driven. But what dreadful beings must be
they who can drive them!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they are driven over us,&#8221; muttered Bawr, &#8220;they
will grind us and our fires into the dust.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be men,&#8221; mused Gr&ocirc;m aloud, &#8220;men far
mightier than ourselves and so countless that the
hordes of the Tree Men would seem a handful in
comparison. Only men, or gods, and in swarms like
locusts, could so drive all these mighty beasts before
them as a child drives rabbits.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Before they come,&#8221; said Bawr, dropping his great
craggy chin upon his breast, &#8220;the People of the Caves
will be trodden out. Whither can we escape from
such foes? We will build great fires before the caves,
and we will go down fighting, as befits men.&#8221;</p>
<p>He lifted his maned and massive head, and shook
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
his great spear defiantly at the unknown doom that was
coming up from the south. But Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s eyes were
sunken deep under his brows in brooding thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is one way, perhaps,&#8221; he said at length.
&#8220;We have learned to journey on the water. We must
build us rafts, many rafts, to carry all the tribe. And
when we can no longer hold our fires and our caves
we will push out upon the water, and perhaps make
our way to that blue shore yonder, where they cannot
follow us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The waves, and the monsters of the waves, will
swallow us up,&#8221; suggested Bawr.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of us, perhaps many of us,&#8221; agreed Gr&ocirc;m.
&#8220;But many of us will escape, to keep the tribe-fires
burning, if the gods be kind upon that day and bind
down the winds till we get over. If we stay here we
shall all die.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is well,&#8221; grunted Bawr, turning to hurry down
the steep. &#8220;We will build rafts. Let us hasten.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>On the beach below the Caves the Men of the Tribe
worked furiously, dragging the trunks of trees together
at the water&#8217;s edge, lashing them with ropes of
vine and cords of hide, and laboriously lopping some
of the more obstructive branches by the combined use
of fire and split stones. The women, and the lame
slave Ook-ootsk&ndash;&ndash;with the old men, who, though their
hearts were still high, were too frail of their hands
for such a heavy task as raft-building&ndash;&ndash;remained before
the Caves under the command of A-ya, Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s mate.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
They had enough to do in feeding the chain of fires,
keeping the children out of danger, and fighting back
with spear and arrow the ever-encroaching mob of
wild-eyed beasts. The beasts feared the fires, and
feared the human beings who leaped and screamed and
smote from among the fires. But still more they
seemed to fear some unknown thing behind them.
For a time, however, the crackling flames and the
biting shafts proved a sufficient barrier, and the motley
but terrifying invaders went sheering off irresolutely
to westward over the downs.</p>
<p>Down by the edge of the tide the raft-builders
worked under Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s guidance. The broad water&ndash;&ndash;some
four or five miles across&ndash;&ndash;was the tidal estuary
of a great river which flowed out of the north-west.
Its brimming current bore down from the interior jungles
the trunks of many uprooted trees, which the
tides of the estuary hurled back and strewed along the
beach. The raft-builders, therefore, had plenty of
material to work with. And the fear that lay chill
upon their hearts urged them to a diligence that was
far from their habit.</p>
<p>It was rather like working in a nightmare. From
time to time would come a rush, a stampede, of
deer or tapirs, along the strip of beach between the
water and the cliff. The toiling men would draw
aside till the rabble went by, then fall to work again.</p>
<p>Once, however, it was a herd of wild cattle, snorting,
and tossing their wide, keen-pointed horns; and their
trampling onrush filled the whole space so that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
men had to plunge out into deep water to escape.
Several, afraid of the big-mouthed, flesh-eating fish
which infested the estuary at high tide, stayed too close
in shore, and paid for their irresolution by being gored
savagely.</p>
<p>It was about the full of the moon and the time
of the longest days, and the raft-builders toiled feverishly
the whole night through. By sunrise Bawr and
Gr&ocirc;m estimated that there were rafts enough to carry
the whole tribe, provided the present calm held on.
They decided, however, to construct several more, in
case some should prove less buoyant than they hoped.</p>
<p>But for this most wise provision Fate refused to
grant the time.</p>
<p>A naked slip of a girl, her one scant garment of
leopard skin caught upon a rock and twitched from off
her loins as she ran, came fleeing down the hill-path,
her hair afloat upon the fresh morning air. Straggling
far behind her came a crowd of children, and old
women carrying babies or bundles of dried meat.</p>
<p>&#8220;They must not come yet. They&#8217;ll be in the way!&#8221;
cried Bawr angrily, waving them back. But they paid
no attention&ndash;&ndash;which showed that there was something
they feared more even than the iron-fisted Chief.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are none of the young women or the old
men, who can fight, among them,&#8221; said Gr&ocirc;m. &#8220;A-ya
must have sent them, because the time has come. Let
us wait for the young girl, who seems to bring a
message.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></p>
<p>Breathless, and clutching at her bosom with one
hand, the girl fell at Bawr&#8217;s feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;A-ya says, &#8216;Come quick!&#8217;&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;They
are too many. They run over the fires and trample
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m sprang forward with a cry, then stopped and
looked at his Chief.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go, you,&#8221; said Bawr, &#8220;and bring them to us. I
will stay here and look to the rafts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taking a half-score of the strongest warriors with
him, Gr&ocirc;m raced up the steep, torn with anxiety for
the fate of A-ya and the children.</p>
<p>It was now about three-quarters tide, and the flood
rising strongly. By way of precaution some of the
rafts had been kept afloat, let down with ropes of
vine to follow the last ebb, and guided carefully back
on the returning flood. But most of them were lying
where they had been built, or left by the preceding tide,
along high-water mark, as hopelessly stranded, for the
next two hours, as a birch log after a freshet. As
the old women with children arrived, Bawr rushed
them down the wet beach to the rafts which were afloat,
appointing to each clumsy raft four men, with long,
rough flattened poles, to manage it. For the moment,
all these men had to do was hold their charges in
place that they might not be swept away by the incoming
tide.</p>
<p>When Gr&ocirc;m and his eager handful, passing a stream
of trembling fugitives on the way, reached the level
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
ground before the Caves, the sight that greeted them
was tremendous and appalling. It looked as if some
great country to the southward had gathered together
all its beasts and then vomited them forth in one vast
torrent, confused and irresistible, to the north. It
was a wholesale migration, on such a scale as the
modern world has never even dreamed of, but suggested
in a feeble way by the torrential drift of the bison
across the North American plains half a century ago,
or the sudden, inexplicable marches of the lemming
myriads out of the Scandinavian barrens that give
them birth.</p>
<p>The shrill cries of the women, fighting like she-wolves
in defense of the children and the home-caves,
the hoarse shouts of the old men, weak but indomitable,
were mingled with an indescribable medley of noises&ndash;&ndash;gruntings,
bellowings, howlings, roarings, bleatings
and brayings&ndash;&ndash;from the dreadful mob of beasts which
besieged the open space behind the fires. Some of the
beasts were maddened with their terror, some were in a
fighting rage, some only wanted to escape the throng
behind them. But all seemed bent upon passing the
fires and getting into the Caves, as if they thought there
to find refuge from the unknown fear.</p>
<p>At the extreme right of the line the two farthest
fires were already overwhelmed, trodden out by frantic
hooves, and three or four old men, with a couple of
desperate young women, behind a barrier of slain elk
and stags were fighting like furies to hold back the
victorious onrush. Two of the old men were down,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
trodden out between the fires by blind hooves, and a
third, jammed limply against the rocky wall beside the
furthest cave, was being worried by a bear&ndash;&ndash;hideously
but aimlessly, as if the great beast hardly heeded what
it was doing. There was something peculiarly terrifying
in the animal&#8217;s preoccupation.</p>
<p>At the center of the line, immediately before the
main Cave-mouth&ndash;&ndash;whose yawning entrance seemed
to be the objective of the swarming beasts&ndash;&ndash;A-ya was
heading the battle, with the lame slave, Ook-ootsk,
crouched fighting at her side like a colossal frog gone
mad. Here the fires were almost extinguished&ndash;&ndash;but
the line of slain beasts formed a tolerable barricade,
upon the top of which the women leapt, stabbing with
their spears and screeching shrill taunts, while the old
men leaned upon the gory pile to save their strength
with frugal precision. Here and there among the carcases
was the body of a woman or an old man, impaled
on the horn of a bull or ripped open by the rending
antler of an elk. As Gr&ocirc;m and his men came
shouting across the level a huge woolly rhinoceros
plunged over the barrier, his bloody horn ploughing
the carcases, trod down a couple of the defenders without
appearing to see them, dashed through the nearest
fire, and charged blindly into the Cave-mouth with
his matted coat all ablaze. The children and old
women who had not already fled down to the beach
shrieked in horror. The frantic monster heeded them
not at all, but went thundering on into the bowels of
the cavern.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Go back, all you women!&#8221; yelled Gr&ocirc;m above the
tumult, as he and his men raced to the barrier. &#8220;Get
down to the beach with the children. We&#8217;ll hold the
rush back till you get down. Run! Run!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sobbing with the fury of the struggle, the women
obeyed, darting back and pouncing upon their own
little ones&ndash;&ndash;all but A-ya, who remained doggedly at
Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go,&#8221; ordered Gr&ocirc;m fiercely. &#8220;The children need
you. Get them all down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sullenly the woman obeyed, seeing he was right,
but still lusting for the fight, though her wearied arm
could now do little more than lift the spear.</p>
<p>Under the shock of these fresh fighters, with lionlike
heads, masterful eyes, and smashing, irresistible
weapons, the front ranks of the animals recoiled,
trampling those behind them; and for a few minutes
the pressure was relieved. Gr&ocirc;m turned to the old
men.</p>
<p>&#8220;You go now,&#8221; he ordered.</p>
<p>But they refused.</p>
<p>&#8220;We stay here,&#8221; cried one, breathless, but with fire
in his ancient eyes. &#8220;None too much room on the
rafts.&#8221; And they fell again grimly to the fight.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m laughed proudly. With such mettle even in
withered veins, the Tribe, he thought, was destined
to great things. He turned to the lame slave, whom he
had ever favored for his faithfulness.</p>
<p>&#8220;You go! You are lame and cannot run.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span></p>
<p>The crouching giant looked up at him with a widemouthed
grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am no woman,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I stay and hold them
back when you all go. I kill, and kill. And then I
go very far.&#8221;</p>
<p>He waved one great gnarled hand, dripping with
blood, toward the sun and the high spaces of air.</p>
<p>Before Gr&ocirc;m could answer, from below the southward
edge of the plateau there came a mad, high
trumpeting, so loud that every other voice in that
pandemonium was silenced by it. At that dread sound
the rabble of beasts surged forward again upon the
barrier, upon the clubs and spears of the defenders.
Up over the brow of the slope came a forest of waving
trunks, and tossing tusks, and ponderous black foreheads.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Two-Tails are upon us!&#8221; cried Gr&ocirc;m, in a
voice of awe. And his followers gasped, as the
colossal shapes shouldered up into full view.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m looked behind him, and saw the last of the
women and children, shepherded vehemently by A-ya
with the butt of her spear, vanishing down the steep
toward the beach.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is time for us to go too,&#8221; shouted Gr&ocirc;m, clutching
the lame slave by the arm to drag him off. But
Ook-ootsk wrenched himself free.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll hold them back till you get away,&#8221; he growled,
and drove his great spear into the heart of a bull which
came over the barrier at that instant. Gr&ocirc;m saw it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
would be useless now to try and save him. With the
rest of his band he ran for paths leading down to
the beach. It was well, he thought, that the valiant
slave should die for the Tribe.</p>
<p>The beasts came over the barrier and the fires like
a yelling flood. But now, finding all opposition so
suddenly withdrawn, the flood divided upon the massive,
thrusting figure of Ook-ootsk as upon a black
rock in mid-stream. It united again behind him, surging
pell-mell for the Cave-mouths, where in the crush
the weaker and lighter were savagely torn and trampled
underfoot.</p>
<p>Then the Mammoths came thundering and trumpeting
across the plateau, going through and over the
lesser beasts like a tidal wave. Gr&ocirc;m, having seen the
last of his warriors pass down the beach paths, turned
for one more glimpse of the monstrous and incredible
scene. He had a swift vision of the squatting form of
Ook-ootsk thrusting upward with reddened spear at
the breast of a black monster which hung over him
like a mountain. Then the mountain rolled forward
upon him, blotting him out, and Gr&ocirc;m slipped hurriedly
over the brink and down the path.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>At the rafts it was bedlam. A score or more of
the women and children, as they were crossing to the
water&#8217;s edge, had been wiped out of existence by the
rush of maddened bison along the beach, and the keenings
of their relatives rose above the shouts and
cries of embarkation. Fully half the rafts were afloat,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
with their loads, by now, and men grunted heavily in
the effort to pry the others free, while women and
children crowded into the water around them, waiting
to struggle aboard as soon as the men would let them.</p>
<p>As Gr&ocirc;m and his panting band, covered with blood
from head to foot, reached the waterside and flung
their dripping weapons upon the rafts, a fringe of
animals came over the edge of the steep, crowded aside
from the caves. Some, being sure-footed, like the
lions and bears, made their way with care down the
paths. Others, pushed over and struggling frantically,
came rolling downward, bouncing from rock and
ledge, and landing on the beach a mass of broken
bones. Then behind them, along the brink, black and
gigantic against the blue sky-line, appeared a group
of the Mammoths. They waved their long trunks,
and trumpeted piercingly, but hesitated to try the
descent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry! hurry!&#8221; thundered Bawr, straining at the
stranded timbers till the great veins stood out on neck
and forehead as if they would burst.</p>
<p>Under the added efforts of Gr&ocirc;m and his band the
last of the rafts floated. The children were thrown
aboard, the women clambered after them, and the men,
wading and guiding, lest the rafts should ground again,
began to follow cautiously.</p>
<p>At this moment, along the beach came a new rush
of animals&ndash;&ndash;chiefly buffalo, headed by three huge white
rhinoceros. These all seemed quite blind with panic.
They dashed on straight ahead, paying no heed whatever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
either to the people on the rafts or to the other
beasts coming down the steep. On their heels
thundered a second herd of Mammoths, their trunks
held high in the air, the red caverns of their mouths
wide open.</p>
<p>As these colossal, rolling bulks came abreast of the
rafts, a child shrieked at the terrifying sight. The
leader of the herd turned his malignant little eye upon
the rafts, seeming to perceive them for the first time.
Without pausing in his huge stride he reached down
his trunk, whipped it about the waist of Bawr, and
swung him aloft, crushing in his ribs with the terrific
pressure, and carried him along high in the air above
the trumpeting ranks.</p>
<p>A howl of rage went up from the rafts; and A-ya,
whose bow was quick as thought, let fly an arrow
before Gr&ocirc;m could stay her hand. The shaft struck
deep in the monster&#8217;s trunk. Dashing down its lifeless
victim among the feet of the herd, the monster
tried to turn back to take vengeance for the strange
wound. But unable to stem the avalanche behind, it
was borne up the beach, screaming with rage.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m, who was now sole chief and master of the
tribe, signed every raft to push out into deep water,
beyond reach of further attack. With all responsibility
now upon his shoulders, he had little time to
grieve for the death of Bawr, who, after all, had died
greatly, as a Chief should. The rafts were now traveling
inland at a fair rate, on the last half-hour of the
flood; and, as the estuary narrowed rapidly above their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
starting-place, he hoped to be able, during the slack
of tide, to work the clumsy rafts well over towards the
northern shore before getting caught in the full
strength of the ebb. As he studied out this problem,
and urged the warriors to their utmost effort on the
heavy and awkward pole-paddles, he kept puzzling all
the time over the great mystery. What was it that
swept even the mighty mammoths before its face?
How should he name the Fear?</p>
<p>Then all at once, when the rafts were about three
or four hundred yards out from shore, he saw. A
low cry of wonder broke from his lips, and was reechoed
in chorus from all the burdened rafts.</p>
<p>Down over the heights where the Cave Folk had
been dwelling, up along the beach from which the rafts
had just escaped, in countless ravening, snapping
swarms, poured hyenas by the myriad&ndash;&ndash;huge hyenas,
bigger than the mightiest timber wolves, their deep-jowled
heads carried close to the ground. It was clear
in a moment that they were mad with hunger, driven
by nothing but their own raging appetites. They fled
from nothing, but some of them stopped, in struggling
masses, to devour the bodies of the beasts which they
found slain, while the rest poured on insatiably, to
pull down by sheer weight of numbers and the might
of their bone-crushing jaws the mightiest of the
monsters which fled before them. Here and there a
mammoth cow, maddened by the slaughter of her calf,
or an old rhinoceros bull, indignant at being hunted by
such vermin, would turn and run amuck through the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
mass, stamping them out by the hundred. But this
made no impression at all, either upon their numbers or
the rage of their hunger, and in a few minutes the
colossus, its feet half eaten off, would come crashing
down, to be swarmed over and disappear like a fat grub
in an ant-heap. Here and there, too, a mammoth,
more sagacious than its fellows, would wade out belly
deep into the water&ndash;&ndash;upon finding its escape cut off&ndash;&ndash;and
stand there plucking its foes one by one from the
shore to trample them under its feet, screaming shrill
triumph.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m turned with a deep breath from the unspeakable
spectacle, looked across to the green line of the
opposite shore, and thanked his unknown gods that it
was so far off. With that great river rolling its flood
between, he thought the Tribe might rest secure from
these fiends and once more build up its fortunes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>THE LAKE OF LONG SLEEP</h3>
</div>
<p>Driven from their home beside the Bitter Water
by the great migration of the beasts, the Tribe
of the Cave Folk, diminished in numbers and stricken
in spirit, had escaped on rafts across the broad river-estuary
which washed the northern border of their
domain. There they had found a breathing-space, but
it had proved a perilous one. The whole region north
of the estuary was little better than a steaming swamp,
infested with poisonous snakes and insects, and with
strange monsters, survivals from a still earlier age,
whose ferocity drove the Cave Folk back to their ancestral
life in the tree-tops. Under these conditions it
was all but impossible to keep alight the sacred fires&ndash;&ndash;as
precious to the tribe as life itself&ndash;&ndash;which they had
brought with them in their flight upon the rafts. And
Gr&ocirc;m, the Chief, saw his harassed people in danger
of sinking back into the degradation from which his
discovery and conquest of fire had so wonderfully uplifted
them.</p>
<p>From the top of a solitary jobo tree, which towered
above the rank surrounding jungle, Gr&ocirc;m could make
out what looked like a low bank of purple cloud along
the western and north-western horizon. As it was
always there, whenever he climbed to look at it, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
concluded that it was not a cloud-bank, but a line of
hills. Where there were hills there might be caves.
In any case, the People must have some better place to
inhabit than this region of swamps and monsters.
The way to that blue line of promise lay across what
would surely be the path of the migrating beasts, if
they should take it into their heads to swim across the
river. The possibility was one from which even his
resolute spirit shrank. But he felt that he must face
any risk in the hope of winning his way to those cloudy
hills. Within an hour of his reaching this decision the
Tribe of the Cave Folk was once more on the march.</p>
<p>The first few days of the march were like a nightmare.
Gr&ocirc;m led the way along the shore of the river,
both because that seemed the shortest way to the hills,
and because, in case of emergency, the open water
afforded a door of escape by raft. Had it been possible
to make the journey by raft matters would have
been simplified; but Gr&ocirc;m had already proved by experience
that his heavy unwieldy rafts could not be
forced upwards against the mighty current of the river.
At the last point to which the flood-tides would carry
them the rafts had been abandoned&ndash;&ndash;herded together
into a quiet cove, and lashed to the shore by twisted
vine-ropes against some possible future need.</p>
<p>At the head of the dismal march went Gr&ocirc;m, with
his mate A-ya, and her two children, and the hairy
little scout Loob, whose feet were as quick as his eyes
and ears and nostrils, and whose sinews were as untiring
as those of the gray wolf. Immediately behind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
these came the main body of the warriors, on a wide
line so as to guard against surprise on the flank. Then
followed the women and children, bunched as closely as
possible behind the center of the line; and a knot of
picked warriors, under young M&ocirc;, the brother of A-ya,
guarded the rear. There were no old men and women,
all these having gone down in the last great battle at
the Caves, selling their lives as dearly as possible to
cover the retreat. Such of the young women as had
no small children to carry bore the heavy burdens of
the fire-baskets, or bundles of smoke-dried meat, leaving
the warriors free to use their bows and spears.</p>
<p>In traversing the swamp the march was sometimes
at ground-level, sometimes high in the tree-tops. In
the tree-tops it was safer, but the progress was slow
and laborious. At ground-level the swarms of stinging
insects were always with them, till Gr&ocirc;m invented
the use of smudges. When every alternate member of
the tribe carried a torch of dry grass and half-green
bark, the march was enveloped in a cloud of acrid
smoke, which the insects found more or less disconcerting.</p>
<p>Of the grave perils of this weary march to the hills
a single instance may suffice. The nights, as a rule,
were passed by the whole tribe in the tree-tops, both
for the greater security, and because there was seldom
enough dry ground to sleep upon. But one evening,
toward sunset, they came upon a sort of little island
in the reeking jungle. Its surface was four or five
feet above the level of the swamp. The trees which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
dotted it were smooth, straight, towering shafts with
wide fans of foliage at their far-off tops. And the
ground between these clean, symmetrical trunks was
unencumbered, being clothed only with a rich, soft,
spicy-scented herbage, akin to the thymes and mints.
Such an opportunity for rest and refreshment was not
to be let slip, and Gr&ocirc;m ordered an immediate halt.</p>
<p>A fat, pig-like water beast, of the nature of the
dugong, had been speared that day in a bayou beside
the line of march, and with great contentment the tribe
settled themselves down to such a comfortable feasting
as they had not known for many days. While the
fat dugong was being hacked to pieces and divided
under the astute direction of A-ya, Gr&ocirc;m made haste
to establish the camp-fires in a chain completely encircling
the encampment, as a protection against night-prowlers
from the surrounding jungle. As darkness
fell the flames lit up the soaring trunks, but the roof
of the over-arching foliage was so high that the smoky
illumination was lost in it.</p>
<p>While the rest of the tribe gave itself up to the
feasting, Gr&ocirc;m and Loob, and half a dozen of the
other warriors, kept vigilant watch whilst they ate,
distrusting the black depths of jungle and the deep,
reed-fringed pools beyond the circle of light.
Suddenly, all along one side of the island there arose
a sound of heavy splashing, and out of the darkness
came a row of small, malignant eyes, all fixed upon the
feasters. Then into the circle of light swam the masks
of giant alligators and strange, tusked caymans.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
Quite unawed by the fires they came ashore with a
clumsy rush, open-mouthed.</p>
<p>While the clamoring women snatched the children
away to the other side of the encampment, Gr&ocirc;m and
the other warriors hurled themselves upon the hideous
invaders as they came waddling with amazing nimbleness
in between the fires. But these were no assailants
to be met with bow and spear. At Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s sharp
orders each warrior snatched a blazing brand from the
fire, and drove it into the gaping throat of his nearest
assailant. In their stupid ferocity the monsters invariably
bit upon the brand before they realized its
nature. Then, bellowing with pain, they wheeled
about and scrambled back toward the water, lashing
out with their gigantic tails, so that three of the
warriors were knocked over and half a dozen of the
fires were scattered.</p>
<p>The feasters had hardly more than settled down
after this startling visitation, when from the darkness
inland came a hoarse, hooting cry, followed by a succession
of crashing thuds, as if a pair of mammoths
were playing leap-frog in the jungle. All the men
sprang again to their weapons, and stood waiting, in
a sudden hush, straining their eyes into the perilous
dark. Some of the women herded the children into
the very center of the island, while others fed the fires
with feverish haste. The hooting call, and the heavy,
leaping thuds, came nearer and nearer at a terrifying
speed; and suddenly, amid the far-off, vaguely-lighted
tangle of the tree-trunks appeared a giant form,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
seven or eight times the height of Gr&ocirc;m himself.
Leaping upon its mighty hind-legs, and holding its
mailed fore-paws before its chest, it came bounding
like a colossal kangaroo through the jungle, smashing
down the branches and smaller trees as it came, and
balancing itself at each spring with its massive,
reptilian tail. Its vast head, something like a cross
between that of a monstrous horse and that of an
alligator, was upborne upon a long, snaky neck, and
its eyes, huge and round and lidless, were like two
discs of shining and enamelled metal where they
caught the flash of the camp-fires.</p>
<p>This appalling shape had apparently no dread whatever
of the flames. When it was within some thirty
or forty yards of the line of fire, Gr&ocirc;m yelled an
order and a swarm of arrows darted from the bows to
meet it. But they fell futile from its armored hide,
which gleamed like dull bronze in the fire-light. Gr&ocirc;m
shouted again, and this time the warriors hurled their
spears&ndash;&ndash;and they, too, fell harmless from the monster&#8217;s
armor. Its next crashing bound brought the monster
to the edge of the encampment, where one of its
ponderous feet obliterated a fire. With a lightning
swoop of its gigantic head it seized the nearest warrior
in its jaws and swung him, screaming, high into the
air, as a heron might snatch up a sprawling frog. At
the same instant A-ya, who was the one unerring
archer in the tribe, let fly an arrow which pierced full
half its length into the center of one of those horrifying
enamelled eyes; while Gr&ocirc;m, who alone, of all the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
warriors, had not recoiled in terror, succeeded in driving
a spear deep into the unarmored inner side of the
monster&#8217;s thigh. But both these wounds, dreadful
though they were, failed to make the colossus drop its
prey. With mighty, braying noises through its
nostrils it brushed the spear shaft from its hold like a
straw, flopped about, and with the arrow still sticking
in its eye, went leaping off again into the darkness to
devour its victim.</p>
<p>For several hours, with the fires trebled in number
and stirred to fiercer heat, the tribe waited for the
monster to return and claim another victim. But it
did not return. At length Gr&ocirc;m concluded that his
spear-head in its groin and A-ya&#8217;s arrow in its eye
had given it something else to think of. Once more
he set the guards, and gradually the tribe, inured to
horrors, settled itself down to sleep. It slept out the
rest of the night without disturbance&ndash;&ndash;but the following
night, and the next two nights thereafter, were
spent in the tree-tops. Then, on the fourth day, the
harassed travelers emerged from the swamp into a
pleasant region of grassy, mimosa-dotted, gently-rolling
plain. The hills, now showing green and
richly wooded, were not more than a day&#8217;s march
ahead.</p>
<p>And just here, as the Fates which had of late been
pursuing them would have it, the worn travelers found
themselves once more in the line of the hordes of
migrating beasts.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s heart sank. To reach the refuge of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
hills across the march of those maddened hordes was
obviously impossible. Were his people to be forced
back into the swamp, to resume the cramped and ape-like
life among the branches? Having ordered the
building of a half-circle of fire around a spur of the
jungle, he climbed a tree to reconnoiter.</p>
<p>The river ran but a mile or two distant upon his
left. Immediately before him the fleeing beasts were
not numerous, consisting merely of small herds and
terrified stragglers. Further out, however, toward the
hills, the plain was blackened by the fugitives, who
were thrust on by the myriads swimming the river
behind them. Assuredly, it was not to be thought of
that he should attempt to lead his people across the
path of that desperate flight. But a point that Gr&ocirc;m
noted with relief was that only certain kinds of
beasts had ventured the crossing of the river. He
saw no bears, lions or saber-tooths among those
streaming hordes. He saw deer of every kind&ndash;&ndash;good
swimmers all of them&ndash;&ndash;with immense, rolling herds
of buffalo and aurochs, and scattered companies of the
terrible siva moose, and some bands of the giant elk,
their antlers topping the mimosa thickets. Here and
there, lumbering along sullenly as if reluctant to retreat
before any peril, journeyed a huge rhinoceros, stopping
from time to time for a few hurried mouthfuls of the
rich plains grass. But as yet there was not a
mammoth in sight&ndash;&ndash;whereat Gr&ocirc;m wondered, as he
thought they would have been among the first to dare
the crossing of the river. Had they kept on up the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
other shore, hesitating to trust their colossal bulks to
the current, or had they turned at bay, at last, in uncontrollable
indignation, and gone down before the
countless hordes of their ignoble assailants?</p>
<p>The absence of the mammoths, which he dreaded
more than all the other beasts because of the fierce intelligence
that gleamed in their eyes, decided Gr&ocirc;m.
He would lead his people along to the right, skirting
the swamp and marching parallel to the flight of the
beasts, calculating thus to have the jungle always for
a refuge, though not for a dwelling, until they should
come to a region of hills and caves too difficult for the
migrating beasts to traverse.</p>
<p>For several days this plan answered to a marvel.
The fugitives nearest to the swamp-edge were mostly
deer of various species, which swerved away nervously
from the line of march, but at the same time afforded
such good hunting that the travelers revelled in abundance
and rapidly recovered their spirits. Once, when
a great wave of maddened buffalo surged over upon
them, the whole tribe fled back into the jungle, clambering
into the trees, and stabbing down, with angry
shouts, at the nearest of their assailants. But the assault
was a blind one. The buffalo, a black mass
that seemed to foam with tossing horns and rolling
eyes, soon passed on to their unknown destination.
And the tribe, dropping down from the branches, quite
cheerfully resumed its march.</p>
<p>On the fifth day of the march they saw the jungle
on their right come to an end. It was succeeded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
by a vast expanse of shallow mere dotted with half-drowned,
rushy islets, and swarming with crocodiles.
After some hesitation, Gr&ocirc;m decided to go on, though
he was uneasy about forsaking the refuge of the trees.
Some leagues ahead, however, and a little toward the
left, he could see a low, thick-wooded hill, which he
thought might serve the tribe for a shelter. With
many misgivings, he led the way directly towards it,
swerving out across the path of a vast but straggling
horde of sambur deer which seemed almost exhausted.</p>
<p>To Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s surprise these stately and beautiful
animals showed neither hostility nor fear toward
human beings. According to all his previous experience,
the attitude of every beast toward man was one
of fear or fierce hate. These sambur, on the contrary,
seemed rather to welcome the companionship of the
tribe, as if looking to it for some protection against the
strange pursuing peril. His sleepless sagacity perceiving
the value of this great escort as a buffer against
the contact of less kindly hordes, Gr&ocirc;m gave strict
orders that none of these beasts should be molested.
And the Cave Folk, not without apprehension, found
themselves traveling in the vanguard of an army of tall,
high-antlered beasts which stared at them with mild
eyes of inquiry and appeal.</p>
<p>Marching at their best speed, the Tribe kept easily
in the van of the distressed sambur, and more than
once in the next few hours, Gr&ocirc;m had reason to
congratulate himself upon his venture into this strange
fellowship. First, for instance, he saw a herd of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
black buffalo overtake the sambur host and dash
heavily into its rear ranks. The frightened sambur
closed up, instead of scattering, and the impetus of the
buffalo presently spent itself upon the unresisting mass.
They edged their way through to the left leaving
swathes of gored and trodden sambur in their wake,
and went thundering off on another line of retreat,
caroming into a herd of aurochs, which fought them
off and punished them murderously. It was obvious
to Gr&ocirc;m, as he studied the dust-clouds of this last
encounter, that the buffalo herd, here in the open,
would have rolled over the tribe irresistibly, and
trampled it flat.</p>
<p>Journeying thus at top speed toward that hill of
promise before them, the travelers came at length
to a wide space of absolutely level ground which presented
a most curious appearance. It was as level
as a windless lake, and almost without vegetation.
The naked surface was of a sort of indeterminate
dust-color, but dotted here and there with tiny patches
of vegetation so stunted that it was little more than
moss. Gr&ocirc;m, with his inquiring mind, would have
liked to stop to investigate this curious surface, unlike
anything he had ever seen before. But the hordes
of the sambur were behind, pressing the tribe onwards,
and straight ahead was the wooded hill, dense with
foliage, luring with its promise of safe and convenient
shelter. He led the way, therefore, without hesitation,
out across the baked and barren waste, sniffing curiously,
as he went, at a strange smell, pungent but not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
unpleasant, which steamed up from the dry, hot surface
all about him.</p>
<p>The first peculiarity that he noticed was a remarkable
springiness in the surface upon which he trod.
Then he was struck by the fact that the dust-brown
surface was seamed and criss-crossed in many places
by small cracks&ndash;&ndash;like those in sun-scorched mud,
except that the cracks were almost black in color.
These things caused him no misgivings. But
presently, to his consternation, he detected a slight but
amazing undulation, an immensely long, immensely
slow wave rolling across the dry surface before him.
He could hardly believe his eyes&ndash;&ndash;for assuredly nothing
could look more like good solid land than that
stretch of barren plain. He stopped short, rubbing
his eyes in wonder. A-ya grabbed him by the arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she whispered, staring at the unstable
surface in a kind of horror.</p>
<p>Before he could reply, cries and shouts arose among
the tribe behind him, and they all rushed forward,
almost sweeping Gr&ocirc;m and A-ya from their feet.</p>
<p>The surface of the barren, all along the edge of the
grass land, had given way beneath the weight of the
sambur herds, and the front ranks were being engulfed
with frantic snortings and awful groans, in what
looked like a dense, blackish, glistening ooze. The
ranks behind were being forced forward to this awful
doom, in spite of their panic-stricken struggles to hold
back; and it was the pressure of this battling mass that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
was creating the horrible, bulging undulation on the
plain.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m&#8217;s quick intelligence took in the situation on
the instant. The naked brown surface beneath the
feet of the tribe was nothing more than a thin crust
overlying a lake of some dense, dark, strange-smelling
liquid.</p>
<p>His first impulse, naturally, was to turn back&ndash;&ndash;and
A-ya, with wide eyes of terror, was already dragging
fiercely at his elbow. But to turn back was utterly
impossible. That way lay the long strip of engulfing
pitch, swallowing up insatiably the ranks of the groaning
and kicking sambur. There was but one possible
way of escape left open, and that was straight ahead.</p>
<p>But would the crust continue to uphold them? Already,
under the weight of the whole tribe pressing
together, it was beginning to sag hideously. With
furious words and blows he tried to make the tribe
scatter to right and left, so as to spread the pressure
as widely as possible. Perceiving his purpose, A-ya
and Loob, and several of the leading warriors,
seconded his efforts with frantic vehemence; till in a
few minutes the whole tribe, amazed and quaking with
awe, was extended like a fan over a front of three or
four hundred yards. Seeing that the perilous sagging
of the crust was at once relieved, Gr&ocirc;m then ordered
the tribe to advance cautiously, keeping the same wide-open
formation, while he himself brought up the rear.</p>
<p>But in a few minutes every one, from Gr&ocirc;m downwards,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
came to a halt irresistibly, in order to watch
the monstrous drama unfolding behind them.</p>
<p>For nearly half a mile to either side of their immediate
rear, between the still unbroken surface of the
dust-brown expanse and the edge of the trampled
grassy plain, stretched a sort of canal, perhaps ten
paces wide, of brown-black, glistening pitch, beaten
up with thrashing antlers, and tossing heads that
whistled despairingly through wide nostrils, and heaving,
agonizing bulks that went down slowly to their
doom. After several ranks of the herd had been engulfed
those next behind turned about in terror and
fought madly to force their way back from the fatal
brink. But the inexorable masses behind them rolled
them on backwards, and slowly they too were thrust
down into the pitch, till the canal was filled to the
brink, and writhed horribly along its whole length.
By this time, however, the alarm had spread through
the rest of the sambur ranks. By a desperate effort
they got themselves turned, and went surging off to
the left in a direction parallel to the edge of the plain
of death.</p>
<p>Thrilled with the wonder and the horror of it, Gr&ocirc;m
drew a deep breath and relaxed the tension of his
watching. He was just about to turn and order the
tribe forward again, when he was arrested by the sight
of a vast cloud of dust rolling up swiftly upon the
left flank of the retreating sambur.</p>
<p>A confused cry of alarm went up from the watching
tribe, as they saw a forest of waving trunks appear in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
the front of the dust-cloud. A second or two more
and a long array of mammoths emerged along the
path of the cloud. Among the mammoths, here and
there, raced a black or a white rhinoceros, or a towering,
spotted giraffe. Behind this front rank, vague
and portentous through the veiling cloud, came further
colossal hordes, filling the distance as far as eye could
see.</p>
<p>This advance looked as if nothing on earth, not even
the lake of pitch, could ever stop it, and certain of the
tribe started to flee. But Gr&ocirc;m, after a moment of
misgiving and hasty calculation, checked the flight
sternly. He must, at all risks see the incredible thing
that was about to happen. And he felt certain that,
at this distance out upon the crust of the gulf, the
tribe would be secure.</p>
<p>The stupendous wave of dust and waving trunks and
galloping black bulks thundered up at a terrific pace,
and fell with irresistible impact upon the flank of the
marching sambur. These unhappy beasts went down
like grass before it. They were rolled flat, trodden out
like a fire in thin grass, annihilated. And the screaming,
trumpeting monsters, hardly aware that there had
been an obstacle in their path, arrived at the edge of the
canal.</p>
<p>Here and there an old bull, leading, took alarm,
trumpeted wildly, and strove to stop. But the belt
of pitch was full to the brink with the packed bodies of
the sambur, and did not look to be a very serious
barrier to the spacious brown levels beyond it. Moreover,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
the panic of a long flight was upon them, and
the rear ranks were thrusting them on. The trumpeting
leaders were overborne in a twinkling. The
ponderous feet of the front rank sank into the mass of
bodies and horns and pitch, stumbled forward, belly
deep, and strove to clamber out upon the solid-looking
further edge. With trunks eagerly outstretched as if
seeking to grip something, the huge, bat-eared heads
heaved themselves up. The next moment the treacherous
crust crumbled away beneath them like an eggshell,
and with screams that tore the heavens they
sank into the gulfs of pitch. The next two or three
ranks went over on them, trod them deeper down,
heaved and surged and battled for some moments
along the edge of the crumbling crust. With mad
trumpetings, they were themselves swallowed up in that
sluggish, implacable flood. Here and there a black
trunk, twisting in agony, lingered long, awful
moments above the pitch. Here and there the pallid
head of a giraffe, tongue protruding and eyes bursting
from their sockets, stood up rigid on its long neck and
screamed hideously.</p>
<p>As the thick tide closed slowly, slowly over its prey,
the hosts in the rear, having taken alarm at the
agonized trumpetings, succeeded by a gigantic effort
in checking their career. Those nearest the edge of
doom reared up and fell back upon those next behind,
to be ripped with frantic tusks in the mad confusion.
But presently the whole colossal array brought itself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
to a halt, got itself turned to the left, and went thundering
off on the trail of the sambur remnants.</p>
<p>Gr&ocirc;m stood staring for a long time, with wide,
brooding eyes, at the still-bubbling and heaving
breadths of dark pitch. He was stunned by the sudden
engulfing and utter disappearance of such a monstrous
horde. He seemed to see the countless gigantic shapes
heaped one upon the other, laid to their long sleep there
in the deeps of the pitch. At last he shook himself,
passed his shaggy hand over his eyes, and shouted to
the tribe that all was well. Then he set himself once
more at their head, and led them, slowly and cautiously,
onward across the dreadful level, till they gained the
shelter of that sweetly wooded and rivulet-watered
hill.</p>
